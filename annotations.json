She underwent an EGD and attempted colonoscopy; however, due to a very poor prep, only a flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed at that time.  A coloscopy is now being performed for completion.,PROCEDURE:,  After proper informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the Endoscopy Suite.  She was placed in the left lateral position and was given sedation by the Anesthesia Department.  A digital rectal exam was performed and there was no evidence of mass.  The colonoscope was then inserted into the rectum.  There was some solid stool encountered.  The scope was maneuvered around this.  There was relatively poor prep as the scope was advanced through the sigmoid colon and portions of the descending colon.  The scope was then passed through the transverse colon and ascending colon to the cecum.  No masses or polyps were noted.  Visualization of the portions of the colon was however somewhat limited.  There were scattered diverticuli noted in the sigmoid.,The scope was slowly withdrawn carefully examining all walls.  Once in the rectum, the scope was retroflexed and nonsurgical internal hemorrhoids were noted.  The scope was then completely withdrawn.

Mr. ABC is being referred for evaluation of glaucoma.  The patient states he has no visual complaints.,On examination, the patient's visual acuity is 20/20 bilaterally.  The patient's visual fields are full to confrontation.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  There is no relative afferent pupillary defect and applanation pressures are 15 mmHg bilaterally.  On slit lamp examination, the patient has a normal anterior segment with 1+ nuclear sclerosis.  On dilated examination, the patient has a cup-to-disc ratio in the right eye of 0.4.  Macula, vessels, and periphery were within normal limits.  On the left eye, the patient has a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.3 and macula vessels and periphery are also within normal limits.  On gonioscopy, the patient shows deep anterior chamber angle OU and is open to the ciliary body band 360 degrees.,In conclusion, my initial impression is that Mr. ABC does not have glaucoma.  He has fairly symmetric and small cup-to-disc ratios OU.  His intraocular pressures were within normal limits in our office today.  I discussed at length with him the alternatives of observation versus continued work-up and testing.  He seemed to understand very well and went with my recommendation to continue observation for now.  We will take fundus photos of his optic nerves for future comparison, but I think given the lack of any strong findings suspicious for glaucoma, we will defer further testing at this time.,Should you have any specific questions or any other information that you think that I may not have included in this evaluation, please feel free to contact me.

There were bowel adhesions noted through the anterior abdominal wall.  The uterus was noted to be within normal limits.  The tubes and ovaries bilaterally were noted to be within normal limits.  The baby was delivered from the right sacral anterior position without any difficulty.  Apgars 8 and 9.  Weight was 7.5 lb.,INDICATIONS FOR THIS PROCEDURE:  ,The patient is a 23-year-old G3 P 2-0-0-2 with reported 30 and 4/7th weeks' for a scheduled cesarean section secondary to repeat x2.  She had her first C-section because of congenial hip problems.  In her second C-section, baby was breached, therefore, she is scheduled for a third C-section.  The patient also requests sterilization.  Therefore, she requested a tubal ligation.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained and all questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction in layman's terms, she was taken to the operating room where a spinal with Astramorph anesthesia was obtained without any difficulty.  She was placed in the dorsal supine position with a leftward tilt and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A Pfannenstiel skin incision was made removing the old scar with a first knife and then carried down to the underlying layer of fascia with a second knife.  The fascia was excised in the midline extended laterally with the Mayo scissors.  The superior aspect of the fascial incision was then tented up with Ochsner clamps and the underlying rectus muscle dissected off sharply with the Metzenbaum scissors.  There was noted dense adhesions at this point as well as a wire mesh was noted.  The anterior aspect of the fascial incision was then tented up with Ochsner clamps and the underlying rectus muscle dissected off sharply as well as bluntly.  The rectus muscle superiorly was opened with a hemostat.  The peritoneum was identified and entered bluntly digitally.  The peritoneal incision was then extended superiorly up to the level of the mesh.  Then, inferiorly using the knife, the adhesions were taken down and the bladder was identified and the peritoneum incision extended inferiorly to the level of the bladder.  The bladder blade was inserted and vesicouterine peritoneum was identified and tented up with Allis clamps and bladder flap was created sharply with the Metzenbaum scissors digitally.  The bladder blade was then reinserted to protect the bladder and the uterine incision was made with a first knife and then extended laterally with the Bandage scissors.  The amniotic fluid was noted to be clear.  At this point, upon examining the intrauterine contents, the baby was noted to be breached.  The right foot was identified and then the baby was delivered from the double footling breach position without any difficulty.  The cord was clamped and the baby was then handed off to awaiting pediatricians.  The placenta cord gases were obtained and the placenta was then manually extracted from the uterus.  The uterus was exteriorized and cleared of all clots and debris.  Then, the uterine incision was then closed with #0 Vicryl in a double closure stitch fashion, first layer in locking stitch fashion and the second layer an imbricating layer.  Attention at this time was turned to the tubes bilaterally.,Both tubes were isolated and followed all the way to the fimbriated end and tented up with the Babcock clamp.  The hemostat was probed through the mesosalpinx in the avascular area and then a section of tube was clamped off with two hemostats and then transected with the Metzenbaum scissors.  The ends was then burned with the cautery and then using a #2-0 Vicryl suture tied down.  Both tube sections were noted to be hemostatic and the tubes were then sent to pathology for review.  The uterus was then replaced back into the abdomen.  The gutters were cleared of all clots and debris.  The uterine incision was then once again inspected and noted to be hemostatic.  The bladder flap was then replaced back into the uterus with #3-0 interrupted sutures.  The peritoneum was then closed with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  Then, the area at the fascia where the mesh had been cut and approximately 0.5 cm portion was repaired with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple stitch fashion.  The fascia was then closed with #0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  The subcutaneous layer and Scarpa's fascia were repaired with a #3-0 Vicryl.

Bunionectomy with first metatarsal osteotomy base wedge type with internal screw fixation.,2.  Akin osteotomy with internal wire fixation of left foot.,HISTORY: , This 19-year-old Caucasian female presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint.  The patient states she has had worsening bunion deformity for as long as she could not remember.  She does have a history of Charcot-Marie tooth disease and desires surgical treatment at this time.,PROCEDURE: , An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap.  Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff.  After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected in a Mayo block type fashion surrounding the lower left first metatarsal.  The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion.  The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg and the foot was lowered to the operating field.  The stockinette was reflected, the foot was cleansed with a wet and dry sponge.  Approximately 5 cm incision was made dorsomedially over the first metatarsal.,The incision was then deepened with #15 blade.  All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis.  Care was taken to preserve the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  The capsule over the first metatarsal phalangeal then was identified where a dorsal capsular incision was then created down to the level of bone.  Capsule and periosteum was reflected off the first metatarsal head.  At this time, the cartilage was inspected and noted to be white, shiny, and healthy cartilage.  There was noted to be a prominent medial eminence.  Attention was then directed to first interspace where a combination of blunt and sharp dissection was done to perform a standard lateral release.  The abductor tendon attachments were identified and transected.  The lateral capsulotomy was performed.  The extensor digitorum brevis tendon was identified and transected.  Attention was then directed to the prominent medial eminence, which was resected with a sagittal saw.  Intraoperative assessment of pes was performed and pes was noted to be normal.,At this time, a regional incision was carried more approximately about 1.5 cm.  The capsular incision was then extended and the proximal capsule and periosteum were reflected off the first metatarsal.  The first metatarsal cuneiform joint was identified.  A 0.45 K-wire was then inserted into the base of the first metatarsal approximately 1 cm from the first cuneiform joint perpendicular to the weightbearing surface.  This K-wire was used as an access guide for a Juvaro type oblique base wedge osteotomy.  The sagittal saw was then used to creat a closing base wedge osteotomy with the apex being proximal medial.  The osteotomy site was then feathered and tilted with tight estimation of the bony edges.  The cortical hinge was maintained.  A 0.27 x 24 mm screw was then inserted in a standard AO fashion.  At this time, there was noted to be tight compression of the osteotomy site.  A second 2.7 x 16 mm screw was then inserted more distally in the standard AO fashion with compression noted.  The ________ angle was noted to be significantly released.  Reciprocating rasp was then used to smoothen any remaining sharp edges.  The 0.45 k-wire was removed.  The foot was loaded and was noted to fill the remaining abduction of the hallux.  At this time, it was incised to perform an Akin osteotomy.,Original incision was then extended distally approximately 1 cm.  The incision was then deepened down to the level of capsule over the base of the proximal phalanx.  Again care was taken to preserve the extensor digitorum longus tendon.  The capsule was reflected off of the base of the proximal phalanx.  An Akin osteotomy was performed with the apex being lateral and the base being medial.  After where the bone was resected, it was feathered until tight compression was noted without tension at the osteotomy site.  Care was taken to preserve the lateral hinge.  At 1.5 wire passed and a drill was then used to create drill hole proximal and distally to the osteotomy site in order for passage of 28 gauge monofilament wire.  The #28 gauge monofilament wire was passed through the drill hole and tightened down until compression and tight ________ osteotomy site was noted.  The remaining edge of the wire was then buried in the medial most distal drill hole.  The area was then inspected and the foot was noted with significant reduction of the bunion deformity.  The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  Capsule was closed with #3-0 Vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure with #4-0 Vicryl in order to decrease tension of the incision site.  A running #5-0 subcuticular stitch was then performed.  Steri-Strips were applied.  Total of 1 cc dexamethasone phosphate was then injected into the surgical site.  Dressings consisted of Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot.  Posterior splint was then placed on the patient in the operating room.,The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications.  The patient was transferred back to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the left foot.  The patient was given postoperative instructions to be strictly nonweightbearing on the left foot.  The patient was given postop pain prescriptions for Vicodin and instructed to take one q.4-6h. p.r.n. for pain as well as Naprosyn 500 mg p.o. q. b.i.d.  The patient is to follow-up with Dr. X in his office in four to five days as directed.\",\r",{"entities":[[35,41,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[43,52,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[80,86,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[87,97,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[120,122,"CARDINAL"],[124,213,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[215,217,"CARDINAL"],[224,261,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[265,274,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[292,303,"CARDINAL"],[333,354,"LOC"],[419,445,"SYMPTOM"],[513,540,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[553,571,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[602,604,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[627,651,"LOC"],[871,881,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[933,941,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[949,973,"LOC"],[986,991,"CARDINAL"],[995,998,"CARDINAL"],[1010,1012,"PERCENT"],[1013,1022,"MEDICATION"],[1033,1037,"PERCENT"],[1038,1046,"MEDICATION"],[1112,1139,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1146,1150,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1225,1229,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1359,1367,"CARDINAL"],[1376,1380,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1453,1457,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1513,1517,"CARDINAL"],[1559,1575,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1613,1616,"CARDINAL"],[1666,1676,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1710,1742,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1766,1793,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1892,1899,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1903,1904,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1937,1958,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1979,1988,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2081,2106,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2140,2156,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2229,2253,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2260,2275,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2325,2344,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2365,2397,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2465,2490,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2683,2689,"CARDINAL"],[2740,2756,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2761,2771,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2795,2811,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2818,2850,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2870,2874,"CARDINAL"],[2920,2938,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2952,2956,"CARDINAL"],[2965,2987,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3079,3119,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3235,3244,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3360,3372,"CARDINAL"],[3485,3494,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3504,3510,"CARDINAL"],[3511,3522,"CARDINAL"],[3672,3691,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3750,3754,"CARDINAL"],[3780,3784,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3849,3855,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3901,3915,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3976,3980,"CARDINAL"],[4035,4042,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4064,4080,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4120,4152,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4159,4166,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4204,4220,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4226,4240,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[4420,4429,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[4487,4490,"CARDINAL"],[4579,4588,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[4618,4620,"CARDINAL"],[4651,4654,"CARDINAL"],[4769,4778,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[4918,4922,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4967,4973,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[5053,5060,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5077,5088,"CARDINAL"],[5101,5121,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[5127,5138,"CARDINAL"],[5201,5225,"CARDINAL"],[5284,5288,"CARDINAL"],[5289,5312,"MEDICATION"],[5390,5394,"CARDINAL"],[5426,5431,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5508,5514,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5522,5531,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5534,5550,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[5731,5735,"LOC"],[5794,5803,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5958,5965,"MEDICATION"],[5989,5992,"CARDINAL"],[5993,6007,"TIME"],[6012,6016,"SYMPTOM"],[6028,6036,"MEDICATION"],[6037,6043,"CARDINAL"],[6052,6058,"TIME"],[6093,6098,"PERSON"],[6113,6133,"TIME"]]}],["        \"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.

Arthroscopy with arthroscopic rotator cuff debridement.,2.  Anterior acromioplasty.,3.  Mumford procedure left shoulder.,SPECIFICATIONS: , The entire operative procedure was done in Inpatient Operative Suite, Room #1 at ABCD General Hospital.  This was done in a modified beach chair position with interscalene and subsequent general anesthetic.,HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: , This is a 38-year-old morbidly obese white male suffering increasing pain in his left shoulder for a number of months prior to surgical intervention.  He was refractory to conservative outpatient therapy.  He had injection of his AC joint, which removed symptoms but was not long lasting.  After discussing the alternatives of the care as well as advantages and disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations, he elected to undergo the above-stated procedure on this date.,Intraarticular viewing of the joint revealed a partial rotator cuff tear on the supraspinatus insertion on the joint side.  All else was noted to be intact including the glenohumeral joint, the long head of the biceps, and the labrum.  The remainder of the rotator cuff observed was noted to be intact.  Subacromially, the patient was noted to have increased synovitis.  Degenerative changes were noted upon observation of the distal clavicle.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was laid supine upon the operative table.  After receiving interscalene block anesthetic by Anesthesia Department, the patient was placed in modified beach chair position.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner.  Portals were created posteriorly and anteriorly from outside to in.  A full and complete diagnostic intraarticular arthroscopy was carried out.  Debridement was carried out through a 3.5 meniscal shaver to the 4.2 meniscal shaver to the undersurface of the partial tear of the rotator cuff.  Retrospectively it was approximately 25% of the generalized thickness.,Attention was then turned to the subacromial region.  The scope was directed subacromially.  A portal was created laterally.  Ultimately, the patient needed a general anesthetic once we were closer to the distal clavicle.  Gross bursectomy was carried out with a 4.2 meniscal shaver.  #18-gauge spinal needles have been placed to outline the anterior acromion prior to this.,It was difficult to control the patient's blood pressure with systolics ranging anywhere from 165 or 170 up to 200.  Because of this and difficulties with his anesthetic, it was elected to change to an open procedure.  Thus, the patient was anesthetized safely and secured.  An oblique incision was carried at the cross Langer's line across the outlet of the shoulder through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  Hemostasis was controlled via electrocoagulation.  Flaps were created.  Anterior deltoid was reflected inferiorly.  Anterior acromioplasty was carried out with a saw then a Micro-Aire and then a beaver-tail rasp.  An excellent decompression was present.  CA ligament had been previously resected.  We then took the incision over the distal clavicle.  The end of the distal clavicle approximately 12 mm to 14 mm was isolated and removed with the Micro-Aire saw.  The beaver-tail rasp was utilized to smooth off the edges.  Pain buster catheter was placed deep to closure of the AC capsule and then to the deltoid with interrupted #1 Vicryl.  Transosseous sutures were placed across the acromion and the deltoid was elevated and closed with the same.  A superficial running #2-0 Vicryl suture was utilized for deltoid closure distally.  Interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized to subcutaneous fat closure, running #4-0 subcuticular stitch for skin closure and Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Elastoplast tape placed for compression dressing.  0.25% Marcaine was flooded into the joint prior to the skin closure.  Pain buster catheter was hooked up.  The patient's arm was placed in arm sling.  He was safely transferred to the PACU in apparent satisfactory condition.  Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is fair.\",\r",{"entities":[[33,35,"CARDINAL"],[37,63,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[68,88,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[90,92,"CARDINAL"],[94,121,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[125,148,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[149,163,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[174,185,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[212,214,"CARDINAL"],[216,241,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[246,267,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[269,271,"CARDINAL"],[273,300,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[304,327,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[329,342,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[365,367,"CARDINAL"],[369,380,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[386,423,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[425,427,"CARDINAL"],[429,451,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[453,455,"CARDINAL"],[457,474,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[474,488,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[551,585,"LOC"],[589,610,"LOC"],[755,766,"CARDINAL"],[767,781,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[813,814,"SYMPTOM"],[826,839,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[856,862,"TIME"],[975,983,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1255,1260,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1272,1297,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1305,1346,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1395,1413,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1419,1442,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1452,1458,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1481,1494,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1529,1542,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1584,1593,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1596,1616,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1652,1667,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1763,1792,"MEDICATION"],[1796,1817,"LOC"],[2033,2059,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2078,2089,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2116,2119,"CARDINAL"],[2143,2146,"CARDINAL"],[2210,2222,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2262,2265,"PERCENT"],[2329,2347,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2501,2516,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2519,2535,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2559,2562,"CARDINAL"],[2581,2590,"CARDINAL"],[2638,2655,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2765,2768,"CARDINAL"],[2772,2775,"CARDINAL"],[2782,2785,"CARDINAL"],[2873,2887,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2991,3004,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3030,3038,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3112,3130,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3154,3170,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3197,3220,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3337,3348,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3414,3430,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3448,3464,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3478,3483,"CARDINAL"],[3487,3492,"CARDINAL"],[3659,3669,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3686,3693,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3711,3720,"CARDINAL"],[3767,3775,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3784,3791,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3854,3865,"CARDINAL"],[3890,3897,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3929,3940,"CARDINAL"],[3991,4015,"CARDINAL"],[4046,4050,"CARDINAL"],[4113,4118,"PERCENT"],[4119,4127,"MEDICATION"],[4149,4154,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4297,4301,"LOC"]]}],["        \"SUBJECTIVE:,\",\r",{"entities":[]}],["        \"S -, A 44-year-old, 250-pound male presents with extreme pain in his left heel.

Sleep has been poor, for multiple reasons.  She has obstructive sleep apnea, and has difficulties with a child who has insomnia related to medications that he takes.  The patient tends to feel irritable, and has crying spells.  She sometimes has problems with motivation.  She has problems with memory, and energy level is poor. Appetite has been poor, but without weight change.  Because of her frequent awakening, her CPAP machine monitor has indicated she is not using it enough, and Medicaid is threatening to refuse to pay for the machine.  She does not have suicidal thoughts.  ,The patient also has what she describes as going into a \\\"panic mode.\\\"  During these times, she feels as if her whole body is going to explode.  She has a hard time taking a deep breath, her heart rate goes up, blood pressure is measured as higher shortly afterward, and she gets a sense of impending doom.  These spells may last a couple of hours, but once lasted for about two day.  She does not get chest pain.  These attacks tend to be precipitated by bills that cannot be paid, or being on a \\\"time crunch.\\\" ,PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY:,  The patient's nurse practitioner had started her on Cymbalta, up to 60 mg per day. This was helpful, but then another physician switched her to Wellbutrin in the hope that this would help her quit smoking.  Although she was able to cut down on tobacco usage, the depression has been more poorly controlled.  She has used Wellbutrin up to 200 mg b.i.d. and Cymbalta up to 60 mg per day, at different times.  At age 13, the patient cut her wrists because of issues with a boyfriend, and as she was being sutured she realized that this was a very stupid thing to do.  She has never been hospitalized for psychiatric purposes.  She did see a psychologist at age 16 briefly because of prior issues in her life, but she did not fully reveal information, and it was deemed that she did not need services.  She has not previously spoken with a psychiatrist, but has been seeing a therapist, Stephanie Kitchen, at this facility.,SUBSTANCE ABUSE HISTORY:,Caffeine:  The patient has two or three drinks per day of tea or Diet Pepsi.,Tobacco:  She smokes about one pack of cigarettes per week since being on Wellbutrin, and prior to that time had been smoking one-half pack per day.  She is still committed to quitting.,Alcohol: Denied.,Illicit drugs:  Denied.

Last surgery consisted of four-level decompression on 08/28/06.  The patient continued to complain of posterior neck pain radiating to both trapezius.  Review of his MRI revealed the presence of what still appeared to be residual lateral recess stenosis.  It also raised the possibility of instability and based on this I recommended decompression and posterolateral spinal instrumention; however, intraoperatively, it appeared like there was no abnormal movement of any of the joint segments; however, there was still residual stenosis since the laminectomy that was done previously was partial.  Based on this, I did total decompression by removing the lamina of C3 through C6 and doing bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy at C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 with no spinal instrumentation.  Operation and expected outcome risks and benefits were discussed with him prior to the surgery.  Risks include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection.  Infection can be superficial, but may also extend down to the epidural space, which may require return to the operating room and evacuation of the infection.  There is also the risk of bleeding that could be superficial but may also be in the epidural space resulting in compression of spinal cord.  This may result in weakness of all four extremities, numbness of all four extremities, and impairment of bowel and bladder function, which will require an urgent return to the operating room and evacuation of the hematoma.  There is also the risk of a dural tear with its attendant problems of CSF leak, headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, pseudomeningocele, and dural meningitis.  This too may require return to the operating room for evacuation of said pseudomeningocele and repair.  The patient understood the risk of the surgery.  I told him there is just a 30% chance that there will be no improvement with the surgery; he understands this and agreed to have the procedure performed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert, not in any form of distress.  After smooth induction and intubation, a Foley catheter was inserted.  Monitoring leads were also placed by Premier Neurodiagnostics for both SSEP and EMG monitoring.  The SSEPs were normal, and the EMGs were silent during the entire case.  After completion of the placement of the monitoring leads, the patient was then positioned prone on a Wilson frame with the head supported on a foam facial support.  Shave was then carried out over the occipital and suboccipital region.  All pressure points were padded.  I proceeded to mark the hypertrophic scar for excision.  This was initially cleaned with alcohol and prepped with DuraPrep.,After sterile drapes were laid out, incision was made using a scalpel blade #10.  Wound edge bleeders were carefully controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to excise the hypertrophic scar.  Dissection was then carried down to the cervical fascia, and by careful dissection to the scar tissue, the spinous process of C2 was then identified.  There was absence of the spinous process of C3, C4, C5, and C6, but partial laminectomy was noted; removal of only 15% of the lamina.  With this completed, we proceeded to do a total laminectomy at C3, C4, C5, and C6, which was technically difficult due to the previous surgery.  There was also a dural tear on the right C3-C4 space that was exposed and repaired with Prolene 6-0 and later with Tisseel.  By careful dissection and the use of a -5 and 3 mm bur, total laminectomy was done as stated with bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy done at C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7.  There was significant epidural bleeding, which was carefully coagulated.  At two points, I had to pack this with small pieces of Gelfoam.  After repair of the dural tear, Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage.  Area was irrigated with saline and bacitracin and then lined with Tisseel.

Bronchoscopy with aspiration.,2.  Left upper lobectomy.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:  ,With patient in supine position under general anesthesia with endotracheal tube in place, the flexible bronchoscope was then placed down through the endotracheal tube to examine the carina.  The carina was in the midline and sharp.  Moving directly to the right side, the right upper and middle lower lobes were examined and found to be free of obstructions.  Aspiration was carried out for backlog ________ examination.  We then moved to left side, left upper lobe.  There was a tumor mass located in the lingula of the left lobe and left lower lobe found free of obstruction.  No anatomic lesions were demonstrated.  The patient was prepared for left thoracotomy rotated to his right side with a double lumen endotracheal tube in place with an NG tube and a Foley catheter.  After proper position, utilizing Betadine solution, they were draped.  A posterolateral left thoracotomy incision was performed.  Hemostasis was secured with electrocoagulation.  The chest wall muscle was then divided over the sixth rib.  The periosteum of the sixth rib was then removed superiorly and the pleural cavity was entered carefully.  At this time, the mass was felt in the left upper lobe, which measures greater than 3 cm by palpation.  We examined the superior mediastinum.  No lymph nodes were demonstrated as well as in the anterior mediastinum.  Direction was then moved to the fascia where by utilizing sharp and blunt dissection, lingual artery was separated into the left upper lobe.  Casual dissection was carried out with superior segmental arteries and left lower lobe was examined.,Dissection was carried out around the pulmonary artery thus exposing the posterior artery to the left upper lobe.  Direction was carried out to the superior pulmonary vein and utilizing sharp and blunt dissection the entire superior pulmonary vein was separated from the surrounding tissue.  From the top side, the bronchus was then separated away from the pulmonary artery anteriorly, thus exposing the apical posterior artery, which was short.  Tumor mass was close to the artery at this time.  We then directed ourselves once again to the lingual artery which was doubly ligated and cut free.  The posterior artery of the superior branch was doubly ligated and cut free also.  At this time, the bronchus of the left upper lobe was encountered in the fissure on palpation to separate the upper lobe bronchus from lower lobe bronchus and the area was accomplished.  We then moved anteriorly to doubly ligate the pulmonary vein using #00 silk sutures for ligation and a transection #00 silk suture was used to fixate the vein.  Using sharp and blunt dissection, the bronchus through the left upper lobe was freed proximal.  Using the TA 50, the bronchus was then cut free allowing the lung to fall superiorly at which time direction was carried out to the pulmonary artery where the tumor was in close proximity at this time.  A Potts clamp arterial was then placed over the artery and shaving off the tumor and the apical posterior artery was then accomplished.  The anterior artery was seen in the clamp also and was separated and ligated and separated.  At this time, the entire tumor in the left upper lobe was then removed.  ,Direction was carried to the suture where #000 silk was used as a running suture over the pulmonary artery and was here doubly run and tied in place.  The clamp was then removed.  No bleeding was seen at this time.  Lymph nodes were then removed from the sump of the separation between the upper lobe and the lower lobe and sent for separate pathology.  We then carried out incision in the inferior pulmonary ligament up to the pulmonary vein allowing the lung to reexpand to its normal position.  At this time, two chest tubes #28 and #32 were placed anteriorly and posteriorly to fixate the skin using raw silk suture.  The chest cavity was then closed.  After reexamination, no bleeding was seen with three pericostal sutures of #1 chromic double strength.  A #2-0 Polydek was then used to close the chest wall muscle the anterior as well as latissimus dorsi #000 chromic subcutaneous tissue skin clips to the skin.  The chest tubes were attached to the Pleur-Evac drainage and placed on suction at this time.  The patient was extubated in the room without difficulty and sent to Recovery in satisfactory.\",\r",{"entities":[[35,44,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[51,67,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[91,94,"CARDINAL"],[95,123,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[125,127,"CARDINAL"],[129,149,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[233,251,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[266,287,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[321,338,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[354,360,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[367,373,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[444,478,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[532,542,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[622,637,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[652,662,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[678,702,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[707,722,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[754,770,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[820,836,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[870,900,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[918,925,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[931,946,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1022,1062,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1107,1125,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1132,1149,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1176,1185,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1192,1219,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1255,1270,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1313,1317,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1333,1349,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1366,1383,"CARDINAL"],[1415,1435,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1441,1452,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1489,1509,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1544,1550,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1598,1612,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1636,1651,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1654,1671,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1693,1720,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1724,1740,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1755,1765,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1793,1809,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1828,1844,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1852,1867,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1903,1926,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1957,1967,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1979,2002,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2070,2078,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2112,2128,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2159,2182,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2202,2213,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2230,2236,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2297,2311,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2322,2336,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2356,2395,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2400,2414,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2453,2484,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2545,2564,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2570,2589,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2650,2663,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2668,2682,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2689,2705,"CARDINAL"],[2737,2752,"CARDINAL"],[2776,2780,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2805,2815,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2821,2829,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2842,2857,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2889,2894,"CARDINAL"],[2900,2908,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2940,2944,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3011,3027,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3130,3136,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3157,3162,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3171,3195,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3223,3238,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3337,3342,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3349,3365,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3428,3437,"CARDINAL"],[3476,3492,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3569,3577,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3601,3613,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3676,3686,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3695,3706,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3760,3768,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3776,3803,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3814,3828,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3842,3846,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3898,3925,"CARDINAL"],[3979,3983,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4012,4024,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4067,4075,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[4118,4144,"CARDINAL"],[4149,4161,"CARDINAL"],[4189,4207,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4231,4247,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4248,4260,"CARDINAL"],[4261,4285,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4299,4303,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"]]}],["        \"She has an extensive past medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and irritable bowel syndrome.

He is scheduled for the above-mentioned procedures.  The planned procedures were discussed with the patient including the associated risks.  The risks included but are not limited to bleeding, infection, nerve damage, failure to heal, possible need for reoperation, possible recurrence, or any associated risk of the anesthesia.  He voiced understanding and agreed to proceed as planned.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was identified in the holding area and correct operative site was identified by the surgeon's mark.  Informed consent was obtained.  The patient was then brought to the operating room and transferred to the operating table in supine position.  Time-out was then performed at which point the surgeon, nursing staff, and anesthesia staff all confirmed the correct identification.,After adequate general LMA anesthesia was obtained, a well-padded tourniquet was placed on the patient's right upper arm.  The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Planned skin incision was marked along the base of the patient's right palm.  Right upper extremity was then exsanguinated using Esmarch.  The tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg.  Skin incision was then made and dissection was carried down with scalpel to the level of the palmar fascia which was sharply divided by the skin incision.  Bleeding points were identified with electrocautery using bipolar electrocautery.  Retractors were then placed to allow visualization of the distal extent of the transverse carpal ligament, and this was then divided longitudinally under direct vision.  Baby Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect distal to this area to confirm the absence of any remaining crossing obstructing fibrous band.  Retractors were then replaced proximally to allow visualization of proximal extent of the transverse carpal ligament and the release was continued proximally until complete release was performed.  This was confirmed by visually and palpably.  Next, baby Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect anteroposterior adjacent antebrachial fascia, and this was divided longitudinally under direct vision using baby Metzenbaum scissors to a level of approximately 3 cm proximal to the proximal extent of the skin incision.  Carpal canal was then inspected.  The median nerve was flattened and injected.  No other abnormalities were noted.  Wounds were then irrigated with normal saline and antibiotic additive.  Decadron 4 mg was then placed adjacent to the median nerve.  Skin incision was then closed with interrupted 5-0 nylon suture.  The wound was then dressed with Adaptic, 4 x 4s, Kling, and Coban.  The tourniquet was then deflated.  Attention was then directed to the left side.  Using sterile technique, the left carpal canal was injected with a mixture of 40 mg of Depo-Medrol, 1 cc of 1% lidocaine, and 1 cc of 0.25% Marcaine.  Band-Aid was then placed over the injection site.  The patient was then awakened, extubated, and transferred over to his hospital bed.  He was transported to recovery room in stable condition.

The patient also had a rent in the attachment of the hip abductors and a partial rent in the vastus lateralis.  This was revealed once we removed the trochanteric bursa.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 56-year-old obese female with a history of bilateral degenerative hip arthritis.  She underwent a right total hip arthroplasty by Dr. X in the year of 2000, and over the past three years, the symptoms in her left hip had increased tremendously especially in the past few months.,Because of the increased amount of pain as well as severe effect on her activities of daily living and uncontrollable pain with narcotic medication, the patient has elected to undergo the above-named procedure.  All risks as well complications were discussed with the patient including but not limited to infection, scar, dislocation, need for further surgery, risk of anesthesia, deep vein thrombosis, and implant failure.  The patient understood all these risks and was willing to continue further on with the procedure.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was wheeled back to the Operating Room #2 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/27/03.  The general anesthetic was first performed by the Department of Anesthesia.  The patient was then positioned with the left hip exposed on the beanbag in the lateral position.  Kidney rests were also used because of the patient's size.  An axillary roll was also inserted for comfort in addition to a Foley catheter, which was inserted by the OR nurse.  All her bony prominences were well padded.  At this time, the left hip and left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure.  At this time, an anterolateral approach was then performed, first incising through the skin in approximately 5 to 6 inches of subcutaneous fat.  The tensor fascia lata was then identified.  A self-retainer was then inserted to expose the operative field.  Bovie cautery was used for hemostasis.  At this time, a fresh blade was then used to incise the tensor fascia lata over the posterior one-third of the greater trochanter.  At this time, a blunt dissection was taken proximally.  The tensor fascia lata was occluded with a hip retractor.  At this time, after hemostasis was obtained, Bovie cautery was used to incise the proximal end of the vastus lateralis and removing the partial portion of the hip abductor, the gluteus medius.  At this time, a periosteal elevator was used to expose anterior hip capsule.  A ________ was then inserted over the femoral head purchasing of the acetabulum underneath the reflected head of the quadriceps muscle.  Once this was performed, Homan retractors were then inserted superiorly and inferiorly underneath the femoral neck.  At this time, a capsulotomy was then performed using a Bovie cautery and the capsulotomy was ________ and then edged over the acetabulum.  At this point, a large bone hook was then inserted over the neck and with gentle traction and external rotation, the femoral head was dislocated out of the acetabulum.  At this time, we had an exposure of the femoral head, which did reveal degenerative changes of the femoral head and once the acetabulum was visualized, we did see degenerative changes within the acetabulum as well as osteophyte formation around the rim of the acetabulum.  At this time, a femoral stem guide was then used to measure proximal femoral neck cut.  We made a cut approximately a fingerbreadth above the lesser trochanter.  At this time, with protection of the soft tissues an oscillating saw was used to make femoral neck cut.,The femoral head was then removed.  At this time, we removed the leg out of the bag and Homan retractors were then used to expose the acetabulum.  A long-handle knife was used to cut through the remainder of the capsule and remove the glenoid labrum around the rim of the acetabulum.  With better exposure of the acetabulum, we started reaming the acetabulum.  We started with a size #44 and progressively reamed to a size #50.  At the size #50 mm reamer, we obtained excellent bony bleeding with good remainder of bone stalk both anteriorly and posteriorly as well as superiorly within the acetabulum.  We then reamed up to size #52 in order to get bony bleeding around the rim as well as anterior and posterior within the acetabulum.  A size 54 mm Trilogy cup was then implanted with excellent approaches approximately 45 degrees of abduction and 10 to 15 degrees of anteversion dialed in.  Once the cup was impacted in place, we did visualize that the cup was well seated on to the internal portion of the acetabulum.  At this time, two screws were the placed within the superior table for better approaches securing the acetabular cup.  At this time, a plastic liner was then inserted for protection.  The leg was then placed back in the bag.  A Bennett retractor was used to retract the tensor fascia lata and femoral elevator was used to elevate the femur for better exposure and at this time, we began working on the femur.  A rongeur was used to lateralize over the greater trochanter.  A Box osteotome was used to remove the cancellous portion of the femoral neck.  A Charnley awl was then used to cannulate through the proximal femoral canal.  A power reamer was then used to ream the lateral aspect of the greater trochanter in order to provide maximal lateralization and prevent varus implantation of our stem.  At this time, we began broaching.  We started with a size #10 and progressively worked up to a size #12 mm broach.  Once the 12 mm broach was inserted in place, it was seated approximately 1 mm below the calcar.  A calcar reamer was then placed and the calcar was reamed smoothly.  A standard neck as well as a 28 mm plastic head was then placed and a trial reduction was then performed.  Once this was performed, the hip was taken to range of motion with external rotation, longitudinal traction as well as flexion and revealed good stability with no impingement or dislocation.  At this time, we removed 12 mm broach and proceeded with implanting our polyethylene liner within the acetabulum.  This was impacted and placed and checked to assure that it was well seated with no loosening.  Once this was performed, we then exposed the proximal femur one more time.  We copiously irrigated within the canal and then suctioned it dry.  At this time, a 12 mm porous proximal collared stem, a femoral component was then impacted in place.  Once it was well seated on the calcar, we double checked to assure that there was no evidence of calcar fractures, which there were none.  The 28 mm zero neck length cobalt-chrome femoral head was then impacted in place and the Morse taper assured that this was well fixed by ________.,Next, the hip was then reduced within the acetabulum and again we checked range of motion as well as ligamentous stability with gentle traction, external rotation, as well as hip flexion.  We were satisfied with components as well as the alignment of the components.  Copious irrigation was then used to irrigate the wound.  #1 Ethibond was then used to approximate the anterior hip capsule.  #1 Ethibond in interrupted fashion was used to approximate the vastus lateralis as well as the gluteus medius attachment over the partial gluteus medius attachment which was resected off the greater trochanter.  Next, a #1 Ethibond was then used to approximate the tensor fascia lata with figure-of-eight closure.  A tight closure was performed.  Since the patient did have a lot of subcutaneous fat, multiple #2-0 Vicryl sutures were then used to approximate the bed space and then #2-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous skin.  Staples were then used for skin closure.  The patient's hip was then cleansed.  Sterile dressings consisting of Adaptic, 4 x 4, ABDs, and foam tape were then placed.  A drain was placed prior to wound closure for postoperative drainage.  After the dressing was applied, the patient was extubated safely and transferred to recovery in stable condition.  Prognosis is good.\",\r",{"entities":[[35,66,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[94,126,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[151,173,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[224,230,"CARDINAL"],[268,276,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[328,333,"CARDINAL"],[365,374,"CARDINAL"],[412,417,"CARDINAL"],[444,448,"CARDINAL"],[473,478,"CARDINAL"],[556,583,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[595,607,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[623,633,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[635,676,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[702,745,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[750,788,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[829,847,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[870,881,"CARDINAL"],[882,887,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[913,949,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[969,996,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1000,1006,"PERSON"],[1021,1025,"DATE"],[1031,1056,"TIME"],[1078,1086,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1124,1147,"TIME"],[1164,1188,"SYMPTOM"],[1200,1247,"SYMPTOM"],[1252,1296,"SYMPTOM"],[1454,1463,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1465,1469,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1471,1482,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1501,1508,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1518,1528,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1530,1550,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1556,1571,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1721,1738,"CARDINAL"],[1742,1763,"LOC"],[1767,1775,"DATE"],[1782,1801,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1895,1905,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2078,2092,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2120,2128,"PERSON"],[2193,2201,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2206,2226,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2322,2344,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2414,2427,"CARDINAL"],[2431,2447,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2454,2472,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2657,2675,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2685,2730,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2749,2765,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2793,2812,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2832,2835,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2930,2966,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3007,3019,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3025,3039,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3097,3117,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3158,3170,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3189,3199,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3225,3254,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3359,3371,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3390,3401,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3451,3462,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3500,3510,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3573,3577,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3630,3642,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3669,3679,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3722,3734,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3753,3773,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3780,3793,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3807,3817,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3845,3866,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3866,3887,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3899,3919,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3931,3952,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4015,4036,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4097,4114,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4167,4219,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[4225,4238,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4286,4289,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4355,4365,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4433,4440,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4456,4470,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4482,4503,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4534,4544,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4569,4579,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4600,4608,"CARDINAL"],[4639,4647,"CARDINAL"],[4657,4675,"CARDINAL"],[4812,4822,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4846,4855,"CARDINAL"],[4945,4955,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4960,4982,"CARDINAL"],[5042,5052,"CARDINAL"],[5070,5087,"CARDINAL"],[5123,5126,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5230,5240,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5345,5359,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5431,5434,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5513,5532,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5577,5582,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5645,5650,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5695,5713,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5718,5732,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[5781,5793,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5850,5872,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5915,5956,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[6097,6107,"CARDINAL"],[6139,6151,"CARDINAL"],[6170,6175,"CARDINAL"],[6234,6238,"CARDINAL"],[6249,6255,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[6298,6304,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[6356,6361,"CARDINAL"],[6396,6412,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[6463,6466,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[6597,6608,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[6612,6623,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[6651,6655,"CARDINAL"],[6728,6738,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[6881,6896,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[6996,7001,"CARDINAL"],[7113,7119,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[7179,7195,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[7225,7247,"CARDINAL"],[7261,7275,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[7378,7381,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[7410,7420,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[7644,7654,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[7693,7704,"CARDINAL"],[7738,7758,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[7761,7772,"CARDINAL"],[7856,7924,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[7952,7970,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[7981,7992,"CARDINAL"],[8026,8045,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[8050,8073,"CARDINAL"],[8144,8160,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[8162,8182,"CARDINAL"],[8244,8255,"CARDINAL"],[8340,8343,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[8404,8410,"CARDINAL"]]}],["        \"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Bilateral inguinal hernia. ,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Bilateral inguinal hernia. ,PROCEDURE: , Bilateral direct inguinal hernia repair utilizing PHS system and placement of On-Q pain pump. ,ANESTHESIA: , General with endotracheal intubation. ,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.

Needles, 24.,BRIEF HISTORY OF THE PATIENT: , This is a 57-year-old male who was seen by us for elevated PSA.  The patient had a prostate biopsy with T2b disease, Gleason 6.  Options such as watchful waiting, robotic prostatectomy, seed implantation with and without radiation were discussed.  Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, incontinence, rectal dysfunction, voiding issues, burning pain, unexpected complications such as fistula, rectal injury, urgency, frequency, bladder issues, need for chronic Foley for six months, etc., were discussed.  The patient understood all the risks, benefits, and options, and wanted to proceed with the procedure.  The patient was told that there could be other unexpected complications.  The patient has history of urethral stricture.  The patient was told about the risk of worsening of the stricture with radiation.  Consent was obtained.,DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: , The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient had SCDs on.  The patient was given preop antibiotics.  The patient had done bowel prep the day before.  Transrectal ultrasound was performed.  The prostate was measured at about 32 gm.  The images were transmitted to the computer system for radiation oncologist to determine the dosing etc.  Based on the computer analysis, the grid was placed.  Careful attention was drawn to keep the grid away from the patient.  There was a centimeter distance between the skin and the grid.  Under ultrasound guidance, the needles were placed, first in the periphery of the prostate, a total of 63 seeds were placed throughout the prostate.  A total of 24 needles was used.  Careful attention was drawn to stay away from the urethra.  Under longitudinal ultrasound guidance, all the seeds were placed.  There were no seeds visualized in the bladder under ultrasound.  There was only one needle where the seeds kind of dragged as the needle was coming out on the left side and were dropped out of position.  Other than that, all the seeds were very well distributed throughout the prostate under fluoroscopy.  Please note that the Foley catheter was in place throughout the procedure.  Prior to the seed placement, the Foley was attempted to be placed, but we had to do it using a Glidewire to get the Foley in and we used a Councill-tip catheter.  The patient has had history of bulbar urethral stricture.  Pictures were taken of the strictures in the pre-seed placement cysto time frame.  We needed to do the cystoscopy and Glidewire to be able to get the Foley catheter in.  At the end of the procedure, again cystoscopy was done, the entire bladder was visualized.  The stricture was wide open.  The prostate was slightly enlarged.  The bladder appeared normal.  There was no sheath inside the urethra or in the bladder.  The cysto was done using 30-degree and 70-degree lens.  At the end of the procedure, a Glidewire was placed, and 18 Councill-tip catheter was placed.  The plan was for Foley to be left in place overnight since the patient has history of urethral strictures.  The patient is to follow up tomorrow to have the Foley removed.  The patient could also be shown to have it removed at home.,The patient was brought to Recovery in stable condition at the end of the procedure.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.\",\r",{"entities":[[35,50,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[79,94,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[110,123,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[125,153,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[159,169,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[185,188,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[239,255,"CARDINAL"],[258,269,"CARDINAL"],[313,324,"CARDINAL"],[353,365,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[386,401,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[407,429,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[466,487,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[489,533,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[572,580,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[582,591,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[593,597,"SYMPTOM"],[599,601,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[603,606,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[608,610,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[612,624,"SYMPTOM"],[626,644,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[646,660,"SYMPTOM"],[661,674,"SYMPTOM"],[709,716,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[718,731,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[733,740,"SYMPTOM"],[742,751,"SYMPTOM"],[753,767,"SYMPTOM"],[796,806,"TIME"],[1036,1054,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1113,1122,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1128,1137,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1357,1374,"MEDICATION"],[1398,1409,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1413,1423,"DATE"],[1426,1448,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1469,1477,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1500,1505,"CARDINAL"],[1747,1759,"CARDINAL"],[1781,1785,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1807,1817,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1853,1858,"CARDINAL"],[1866,1891,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1904,1912,"CARDINAL"],[1940,1948,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1962,1972,"CARDINAL"],[2034,2041,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2050,2073,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2150,2157,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2164,2174,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2389,2397,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2404,2415,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2688,2713,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2743,2753,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2819,2829,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2921,2931,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2953,2960,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2982,2991,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3012,3020,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3049,3056,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3106,3113,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3124,3131,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3138,3143,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3159,3168,"CARDINAL"],[3172,3182,"CARDINAL"],[3221,3241,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3247,3262,"CARDINAL"],[3328,3337,"TIME"],[3371,3390,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3421,3429,"DATE"]]}],["        \"MANNER OF DEATH: , Homicide.,CAUSE OF DEATH:,\",\r",{"entities":[]}],["        \"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.

The patient complains of difficulties with glare in performing activities of daily living.,INFORMED CONSENT:,  The risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient in the office prior to scheduling surgery.  All questions from the patient were answered after the surgical procedure was explained in detail.  The risks of the procedure as explained to the patient include, but are not limited to, pain, infection, bleeding, loss of vision, retinal detachment, need for further surgery, loss of lens nucleus, double vision, etc.  Alternative of the procedure is to do nothing or seek a second opinion.  Informed consent for this procedure was obtained from the patient.,OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: , The patient was brought to the holding area.  Previously, an intravenous infusion was begun at a keep vein open rate.  After adequate sedation by the anesthesia department (under monitored anesthesia care conditions), a peribulbar and retrobulbar block was given around the operative eye.  A total of 10 mL mixture with a 70/30 mixture of 2% Xylocaine without epinephrine and 0.75% bupivacaine without epinephrine.  An adequate amount of anesthetic was infused around the eye without giving excessive tension to the eye or excessive chemosis to the periorbital area.  Manual pressure and a Honan balloon were placed over the eye for approximately 2 minutes after injection and adequate akinesia and anesthesia was noted.  Vital sign monitors were detached from the patient.  The patient was moved to the operative suite and the same monitors were reattached.  The periocular area was cleansed, dried, prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner for ocular surgery.  The speculum was set into place and the operative microscope was brought over the eye.  The eye was examined.  Adequate mydriasis was observed and a visually significant cataract was noted on the visual axis.,A temporal clear corneal incision was begun using a crescent blade with an initial groove incision made partial thickness through the temporal clear cornea.  Then a pocket incision was created without entering the anterior chamber of the eye.  Two peripheral paracentesis ports were created on each side of the initial incision site.  Viscoelastic was used to deepen the anterior chamber of the eye.  A 2.65 mm keratome was then used to complete the corneal valve incision.  A cystitome was bent and created using a tuberculin syringe needle.  It was placed in the anterior chamber of the eye.  A continuous curvilinear capsulorrhexis was begun.  It was completed using O'Gawa Utrata forceps.  A balanced salt solution on the irrigating cannula was placed through the paracentesis port of the eye to affect hydrodissection and hydrodelineation of the lens nucleus.  The lens nucleus was noted to be freely mobile in the bag.,The phacoemulsification tip was placed into the anterior chamber of the eye.  The lens nucleus was phacoemulsified and aspirated in a divide-and-conquer technique.  All remaining cortical elements were removed from the eye using irrigation and aspiration using a bimanual technique through the paracentesis ports.  The posterior capsule remained intact throughout the entire procedure.  Provisc was used to deepen the anterior chamber of the eye.  A crescent blade was used to expand the internal aspect of the wound.  The lens was taken from its container and inspected.  No defects were found.  The lens power selected was compared with the surgery worksheet from Dr. X's office.  The lens was placed in an inserter under Provisc.  It was placed through the wound, into the capsular bag and extruded gently from the inserter.  It was noted to be adequately centered in the capsular bag using a Sinskey hook.  The remaining viscoelastic was removed from the eye with irrigation an aspiration through the paracentesis side ports using a bimanual technique.  The eye was noted to be inflated without overinflation.  The wounds were tested for leaks, none were found.  Five drops dilute Betadine solution was placed over the eye.  The eye was irrigated.  The speculum was removed.  The drapes were removed.  The periocular area was cleaned and dried.  Maxitrol ophthalmic ointment was placed into the interpalpebral space.  A semi-pressure patch and shield was placed over the eye.  The patient was taken to the floor in stable and satisfactory condition, was given detailed written instructions and asked to follow up with Dr. X tomorrow morning in the office.\",\r",{"entities":[[33,35,"CARDINAL"],[37,60,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[61,70,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[72,74,"CARDINAL"],[75,100,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[102,110,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[139,141,"CARDINAL"],[142,166,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[168,177,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[178,180,"CARDINAL"],[182,206,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[208,216,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[234,265,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[267,291,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[295,303,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[341,347,"CARDINAL"],[358,371,"CARDINAL"],[403,422,"TIME"],[426,431,"PERCENT"],[510,518,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[535,538,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[620,625,"CARDINAL"],[653,676,"SYMPTOM"],[859,866,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1057,1061,"SYMPTOM"],[1063,1072,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1074,1082,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1084,1098,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1100,1118,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1137,1144,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1146,1166,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1168,1181,"SYMPTOM"],[1454,1458,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1486,1494,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1572,1605,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1636,1639,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1653,1658,"CARDINAL"],[1674,1679,"CARDINAL"],[1691,1693,"PERCENT"],[1694,1703,"MEDICATION"],[1712,1723,"MEDICATION"],[1728,1733,"PERCENT"],[1734,1745,"MEDICATION"],[1754,1765,"MEDICATION"],[1824,1827,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1868,1871,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1885,1893,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1901,1917,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1942,1955,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1999,2008,"TIME"],[2038,2046,"SYMPTOM"],[2216,2231,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2304,2318,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2403,2406,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2413,2416,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2441,2450,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2491,2499,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2517,2528,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2532,2540,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2547,2563,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2664,2685,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2744,2771,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2900,2928,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2933,2940,"CARDINAL"],[2980,3002,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3095,3122,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3127,3164,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3298,3310,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3323,3326,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3337,3352,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3357,3373,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3381,3393,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3400,3412,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3503,3530,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3536,3549,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3674,3677,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3684,3694,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3699,3709,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3749,3761,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3774,3792,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3873,3900,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3978,3982,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4056,4060,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4098,4105,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[4121,4128,"PERSON"],[4142,4146,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4414,4417,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4423,4433,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[4437,4447,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[4460,4472,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[4517,4520,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4622,4632,"CARDINAL"],[4678,4681,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4687,4688,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4765,4781,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4805,4813,"MEDICATION"],[4854,4874,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4930,4933,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5077,5082,"PERSON"],[5083,5099,"TIME"]]}],["        \"EXAM:,MRI RIGHT ANKLE,CLINICAL:,This is a 51 year old female who first came into the office 3/4/05 with right ankle pain.

The patient reports that she was hospitalized over the weekend for DKA.  She indicates that her blood sugar on Friday night was 187 at bedtime and that when she woke up in the morning her blood sugar was 477.  She gave herself, in smaller increments, a total of 70 extra units of her Humalog.  Ten of those units were injectable; the others were in the forms of pump.  Her blood sugar was over 600 when she went to the hospital later that day.  She is here at this consultation complaining of not feeling well still because she has a cold.  She realizes that this is likely because her immune system was so minimized in the hospital.,OBJECTIVE:,  Current insulin doses on her insulin pump are boluses set at 5 units at breakfast, 6 units at lunch and 11 units at supper.  Her basal rates have not been changed since her last visit with Charla Yassine and totaled 30.5 units per 24 hours.  A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on carbohydrate counting at 1 unit of insulin for every 10 g carbohydrate ratio was recommended.  A correction dose of approximately 1 unit of insulin to bring the blood sugars down 30 mg/dl was also recommended.  The Lilly guide for meal planning was provided and reviewed.  Additional carbohydrate counting book was provided.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient was taught an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio of 1 unit to 10 g of carbohydrates as recommended at the previous visit two years ago, which she does not recall.  It is based on the 500 rule which suggests this ratio.  We did identify carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing 15-g equivalents.  We also identified the need to dose her insulin at the time that she is eating her carbohydrate sources.  She does seem to have a pattern of fixing blood sugars later in the day after they are elevated.  We discussed the other option of trying to eat a consistent amount of carbohydrates at meals from day to day and taking a consistent amount of insulin at those meals.  With this in mind, she was recommended to follow with three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at breakfast, three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at lunch and four servings or 60 g of carbohydrate at dinner.  Joanne Araiza joined our consultation briefly to discuss whether her pump was working appropriately.  The patient was given an 800 number for the pump to contact should there be any question about its failure to deliver insulin appropriately.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient use 1 unit of insulin for every 10-g carbohydrate load consumed.  Recommend the patient either use this as a carbohydrate counting tool or work harder at keeping carbohydrate content consistent at meals from day to day.  This was a one-hour consultation.

He was presented at Tumor Board where it was thought upon review that day that he had a right nodular malignant mesothelioma.  Thus, he was offered a right thoracotomy and excision of mass with possible reconstruction of the diaphragm.  He was explained the risks, benefits, and alternatives to this procedure.  He wished to proceed, so he was brought to the operating room.,An epidural catheter was placed.  He was put in a supine position where SCDs and Foley catheter were placed.  He was put under general endotracheal anesthesia with a double-lumen endotracheal tube.  He was given preoperative antibiotics, then he was placed in the left decubitus position, and the area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.,A low thoracotomy in the 7th interspace was made using the skin knife and then Bovie cautery onto the middle of the rib and then with the Alexander instrument, the chest was entered.  Upon entering the chest, the chest wall retractor was inserted and the cavity inspected.  It appeared that the mass actually arose more from the right lower lobe and was involving the diaphragm.  He also had some marked lymphadenopathy.  With these findings, which were thought at that time to be more consistent with a bronchogenic carcinoma, we proceeded with the intent to perform a right lower lobectomy and en bloc diaphragmatic resection.  Thus, we mobilized the inferior pulmonary ligament and made our way around the hilum anteriorly and posteriorly.  We also worked to open the fissure and tried to identify the arteries going to the superior portion of the right lower lobe and basilar arteries as well as the artery going to the right middle lobe.  The posterior portion of the fissure ultimately divided with the single firing of a GIA stapler with a blue load and with the final portion being divided between 2-0 ties.  Once we had clearly delineated the arterial anatomy, we were able to pass a right angle around the artery going to the superior segment.  This was ligated in continuity with an additional stick tie in the proximal portion of 3-0 silk.  This was divided thus revealing a branched artery going to the basilar portion of the right lower lobe.  This was also ligated in continuity and actually doubly ligated.  Care was taken to preserve the artery to the right and middle lobe.,We then turned our attention once again to the hilum to dissect out the inferior pulmonary vein.  The superior pulmonary vein was visualized as well.  The right angle was passed around the inferior pulmonary vein, and this was ligated in continuity with 2-0 silk and a 3-0 stick tie.  Upon division of this portion, the specimen site had some bleeding, which was eventually controlled using several 3-0 silk sutures.  The bronchial anatomy was defined.  Next, we identified the bronchus going to the right lower lobe as well as the right middle lobe.  A TA-30 4.8 stapler was then closed.  The lung insufflated.  The right middle lobe and right upper lobe were noted to inflate well.  The stapler was fired, and the bronchus was cut with a 10-blade.,We then turned our attention to the diaphragm.  There was a small portion of the diaphragm of approximately 4 to 5 cm has involved with tumor, and we bovied around this with at least 1 cm margin.  Upon going through the diaphragm, it became clear that the tumor was also involving the dome of the liver, so after going around the diaphragm in its entirety, we proceeded to wedge out the portion of liver that was involved.  It seemed that it would be a mucoid shallow portion.  The Bovie was set to high cautery.  The capsule was entered, and then using Bovie cautery, we wedged out the remaining portion of the tumor with a margin of normal liver.  It did leave quite a shallow defect in the liver.  Hemostasis was achieved with Bovie cautery and gentle pressure.  The specimen was then taken off the table and sent to Pathology for permanent.  The area was inspected for hemostasis.  A 10-flat JP was placed in the abdomen at the portion of the wedge resection, and 0 Prolene was used to close the diaphragmatic defect, which was under very little tension.  A single 32 straight chest tube was also placed.  The lung was seen to expand.  We also noted that the incomplete fissure between the middle and upper lobes would prevent torsion of the right middle lobe.  Hemostasis was observed at the end of the case.  The chest tube was irrigated with sterile water, and there was no air leak observed from the bronchial stump.  The chest was then closed with Vicryl at the level of the intercostal muscles, staying above the ribs.  The 2-0 Vicryl was used for the latissimus dorsi layer and the subcutaneous layer, and 4-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin.  The patient was then brought to supine position, extubated, and brought to the recovery room in stable condition.,Dr. X was present for the entirety of the procedure, which was a right thoracotomy, right lower lobectomy with en bloc resection of diaphragm and a portion of liver.\",\r",{"entities":[[35,53,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[82,126,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[140,195,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[209,211,"CARDINAL"],[213,230,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[232,234,"CARDINAL"],[236,257,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[263,314,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[329,350,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[356,407,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[423,429,"CARDINAL"],[453,458,"CARDINAL"],[463,469,"CARDINAL"],[508,538,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[658,673,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[722,738,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[765,780,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[871,907,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[933,951,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[954,971,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[986,1017,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1161,1189,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1230,1265,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1285,1316,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1370,1394,"MEDICATION"],[1507,1522,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1530,1544,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1607,1625,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1669,1674,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1707,1712,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1718,1729,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1760,1766,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1800,1804,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1834,1851,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1873,1882,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1902,1924,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2009,2031,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2074,2096,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2101,2132,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2158,2185,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2214,2219,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2276,2283,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2310,2318,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2356,2372,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2377,2393,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2409,2415,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2429,2446,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2453,2485,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2611,2619,"CARDINAL"],[2657,2673,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2721,2727,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2741,2757,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2847,2855,"CARDINAL"],[2892,2908,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2920,2960,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3060,3066,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3073,3095,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3144,3149,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3169,3192,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3198,3222,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3286,3309,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3351,3360,"CARDINAL"],[3365,3379,"CARDINAL"],[3440,3448,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3496,3503,"CARDINAL"],[3519,3537,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3575,3583,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3597,3613,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3629,3646,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3651,3668,"CARDINAL"],[3691,3695,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3714,3731,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3736,3752,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3813,3821,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3837,3845,"CARDINAL"],[3883,3892,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3928,3937,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3955,3964,"CARDINAL"],[3983,3988,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[4030,4035,"CARDINAL"],[4067,4076,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4103,4108,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[4132,4149,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4177,4186,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4245,4250,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4459,4464,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[4489,4494,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4540,4545,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4735,4743,"CARDINAL"],[4764,4771,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4815,4825,"CARDINAL"],[4847,4867,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[4916,4927,"CARDINAL"],[4928,4954,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[4961,4965,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5041,5063,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5093,5110,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5166,5171,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5255,5270,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5277,5282,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5330,5350,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5370,5374,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5381,5392,"CARDINAL"],[5408,5431,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5440,5458,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5464,5476,"CARDINAL"],[5499,5503,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5555,5564,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[5620,5626,"PERSON"],[5685,5702,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[5704,5785,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"]]}],["        \"NAME OF PROCEDURE,1.  Left heart catheterization with left ventriculography and selective coronary angiography.,2.  Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent placement of the right coronary artery.,HISTORY: , This is a 58-year-old male who presented with atypical chest discomfort.  The patient had elevated troponins which were suggestive of a myocardial infarction.  The patient is suspected of having significant obstructive coronary artery disease, therefore he is undergoing cardiac catheterization.,PROCEDURE DETAILS: , Informed consent was given prior to the patient was brought to the catheterization laboratory.  The patient was brought to the catheterization laboratory in postabsorptive state.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion, 2% Xylocaine solution was used to anesthetize the right femoral region.  Using modified Seldinger technique, a 6-French arterial sheath was placed.  Then, the patient had already been on heparin.  Then, a Judkins left 4 catheter was intubated into the left main coronary artery.  Several projections were obtained and the catheter was removed.  A 3DRC catheter was intubated into the right coronary artery.  Several projections were obtained and the catheter was removed.  Then, a 3DRC guiding catheter was intubated into the right coronary artery.  Then, a universal wire was advanced across the lesion into the distal right coronary artery.  Integrilin was given.  Then, a 3.0 x 12 Voyager balloon was inflated at 13 atmospheres for 30 seconds.  Then, a projection was obtained.  Then, a 3.0 x 15 Vision stent was placed into the distal right coronary artery.  The stent was deployed at 15 atmospheres for 25 seconds.  Post stent, the patient was given intracoronary nitroglycerin after one projection.  Then, there was an attempt to place the intervention wire across the third posterolateral branch which was partially obstructed and this was not successful.  Then, a pilot 150 wire was advanced across the lesion.  Then, attempt to place the 2.0 x 8 power saver across the lesion was performed.  However, it was felt that there was adequate flow and no further intervention needed to be performed.  Then, the stent delivery system was removed.  A pigtail catheter was placed into the left ventricle.  Hemodynamics followed by left ventriculography was performed.  Then, a pullback gradient was performed and the catheter was removed.  Then, the right femoral artery was visualized and using angiography and then an Angio-Seal was applied.  The patient was transferred back to his room in good condition.,FINDINGS,1.  Hemodynamics:  The opening aortic pressure was 116/61 with a mean of 64.  The opening left ventricular pressure was 112 with end-diastolic pressure of 23.  LV pressure on pullback was 106 with end-diastolic pressure of 21.  Aortic pressure was 111/67 with a mean of 87.  The closing pressure was 110/67.,2.  Left ventriculography:  The left ventricle was of normal cavity, size, and wall thickness.  There is a mild anterolateral hypokinesis and moderate inferior and inferoapical hypokinesis.  The overall systolic function appeared to be mildly reduced with ejection fraction between 40% and 45%.  The mitral valve had no significant prolapse or regurgitation.  The aortic valve appeared to be trileaflet and moved normally.,3.  Coronary angiography:  The left main is a normal-caliber vessel.  This bifurcates into the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries.  The left main is free of any significant obstructive coronary artery disease.  The left anterior descending is a large vessel that extends to the apex.  It gives off approximately 10 septal perforators and 5 diagonal branches.  The first diagonal branch was large.  The left anterior descending had mild irregularities, but no high-grade disease.  The left circumflex is a nondominant vessel, which gives rise to two obtuse marginal branches.  The two obtuse marginal branches are large.  There is a relatively small left atrial branch.  The left circumflex had a 50% stenosis after the first obtuse marginal branch.  The rest of the vessel is moderately irregular, but no high-grade disease.  The right coronary artery appears to be a dominant vessel, which gives rise to three right ventricular branches, four posterior lateral branches, two right atrial branches, and two small conus branches.  The right coronary artery had moderate disease in its proximal segment with multiple areas of plaquing but no high-grade disease.  However, distal between the second and third posterolateral branch, there is a 90% stenosis.  The rest of the vessels had mild irregularities, but no high-grade disease.  Then percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the right coronary artery resulted in a 20% residual stenosis.  Then, after stent placement there was 0% residual stenosis; however, there was partial occlusion of the third posterolateral branch.  Then, a wire was advanced through this and there was improvement of flow.  There is improvement from TIMI grade 2 to TIMI grade 3 flow.,CLINICAL IMPRESSION,1.  Successful percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent placement of the right coronary artery.,2.  Two-vessel coronary artery disease.,3.  Elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.,4.  Mild anterolateral and moderate inferoapical hypokinesis.,RECOMMENDATIONS,1.  Integrilin.,2.  Bed rest.,3.  Risk factor modification.,4.  Thallium scintigraphy in approximately six weeks.\",\r",{"entities":[[27,29,"CARDINAL"],[31,57,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[62,84,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[89,119,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[121,123,"CARDINAL"],[125,172,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[176,192,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[199,220,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[243,254,"CARDINAL"],[279,304,"SYMPTOM"],[369,390,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[440,475,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[503,527,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[794,797,"PERCENT"],[798,807,"MEDICATION"],[845,865,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[883,902,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[906,914,"CARDINAL"],[915,941,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[982,989,"MEDICATION"],[1013,1014,"CARDINAL"],[1046,1072,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1142,1146,"CARDINAL"],[1179,1200,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1276,1280,"CARDINAL"],[1321,1342,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1392,1398,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1408,1436,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1439,1449,"MEDICATION"],[1470,1478,"CARDINAL"],[1511,1525,"CARDINAL"],[1530,1540,"TIME"],[1585,1607,"CARDINAL"],[1627,1655,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1684,1698,"CARDINAL"],[1703,1713,"TIME"],[1750,1777,"MEDICATION"],[1784,1798,"CARDINAL"],[1870,1897,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1973,1982,"CARDINAL"],[2006,2012,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2042,2055,"CARDINAL"],[2073,2079,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2247,2275,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2284,2298,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2301,2313,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2325,2347,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2445,2465,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2491,2502,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2514,2538,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2613,2615,"CARDINAL"],[2664,2670,"CARDINAL"],[2686,2688,"CARDINAL"],[2733,2736,"CARDINAL"],[2768,2770,"CARDINAL"],[2801,2804,"CARDINAL"],[2836,2838,"CARDINAL"],[2860,2867,"CARDINAL"],[2883,2885,"CARDINAL"],[2913,2922,"CARDINAL"],[2925,2946,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2953,2967,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3028,3058,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3063,3109,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3195,3214,"PERCENT"],[3221,3234,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3253,3261,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3265,3278,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3285,3297,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3344,3346,"CARDINAL"],[3348,3368,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3405,3411,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3438,3487,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3494,3503,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3531,3566,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3573,3597,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3609,3615,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3636,3640,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3670,3692,"CARDINAL"],[3695,3715,"CARDINAL"],[3722,3727,"CARDINAL"],[3728,3743,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3760,3784,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3842,3857,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3875,3881,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3903,3906,"CARDINAL"],[3907,3931,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3938,3941,"CARDINAL"],[3941,3966,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4007,4025,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4032,4047,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4054,4057,"PERCENT"],[4058,4066,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[4077,4082,"CARDINAL"],[4082,4105,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4124,4130,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4188,4209,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4235,4241,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4263,4268,"CARDINAL"],[4268,4295,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4297,4301,"CARDINAL"],[4302,4328,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4330,4333,"CARDINAL"],[4333,4355,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4361,4364,"CARDINAL"],[4365,4385,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4392,4413,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4482,4490,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[4547,4553,"CARDINAL"],[4558,4563,"CARDINAL"],[4564,4585,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4598,4601,"PERCENT"],[4602,4610,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[4629,4636,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4695,4741,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[4749,4770,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4785,4788,"PERCENT"],[4789,4806,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[4821,4836,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[4847,4849,"PERCENT"],[4850,4867,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[4888,4905,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[4913,4918,"CARDINAL"],[4919,4940,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5044,5057,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[5060,5077,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[5099,5103,"CARDINAL"],[5114,5151,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[5156,5200,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[5202,5204,"CARDINAL"],[5205,5240,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[5242,5245,"CARDINAL"],[5246,5295,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[5296,5299,"CARDINAL"],[5300,5356,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[5374,5376,"CARDINAL"],[5378,5388,"MEDICATION"],[5390,5393,"CARDINAL"],[5404,5407,"CARDINAL"],[5434,5436,"CARDINAL"],[5438,5459,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[5460,5487,"CARDINAL"]]}],["        \"HISTORY:,  I had the pleasure of meeting and evaluating the patient referred today for evaluation and treatment of chronic sinusitis.  As you are well aware, she is a pleasant 50-year-old female who states she started having severe sinusitis about two to three months ago with facial discomfort, nasal congestion, eye pain, and postnasal drip symptoms.  She states she really has sinus problems, but this infection has been rather severe and she notes she has not had much improvement with antibiotics.  She had a CT of her paranasal sinuses identifying mild mucosal thickening of right paranasal sinuses with occlusion of the ostiomeatal complex on the right and turbinate hypertrophy was also noted when I reviewed the films and there is some minimal nasal septum deviation to the left.  She currently is not taking any medication for her sinuses.  She also has noted that she is having some problems with her balance and possible hearing loss or at least ear popping and fullness.  Her audiogram today demonstrated mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, normal tympanometry, and normal speech discrimination.  She has tried topical nasal corticosteroid therapy without much improvement.  She tried Allegra without much improvement and she believes the Allegra may have caused problems with balance to worsen.  She notes her dizziness to be much worse if she does quick positional changes such as head turning or sudden movements, no ear fullness, pressure, humming, buzzing or roaring noted in her ears.  She denies any previous history of sinus surgery or nasal injury.  She believes she has some degree of allergy symptoms.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Seasonal allergies, possible food allergies, chronic sinusitis, hypertension and history of weight change.  She is currently 180 pounds.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,  Lower extremity vein stripping, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Strong for heart disease and alcoholism.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , DynaCirc.,ALLERGIES: , Egg-based products cause hives.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,The patient used to smoke cigarettes for about 20 years, one-half pack a day.  She currently does not, which was encouraged to continue.  She rarely drinks any alcohol-containing beverages.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: ,VITAL SIGNS:  Age 50, blood pressure is 136/74, pulse 84, temperature is 98.4, weight is 180 pounds, and height is 5 feet 3 inches.,GENERAL:  The patient is healthy appearing; alert and oriented to person, place and time; responds appropriately; in no acute distress.,HEAD:  Normocephalic.  No masses or lesions noted.,FACE:  No facial tenderness or asymmetry noted.,EYES:  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation bilaterally.  Extraocular movements are intact bilaterally.  No nystagmus.,EARS:  During Hallpike examination, the patient did not become dizzy until she would be placed back into sitting in the upright position.  No nystagmus was appreciated; however, the patient did subjectively report dizziness, which was repeated twice.  No evidence of any orthostatic hypotension was noted during the exam.  Tympanic membranes were noted to be intact.  No signs of middle ear effusion or ear canal inflammation.,NOSE:  The patient appears congested.  Turbinate hypertrophy is noted.  There are no signs of any acute sinusitis.  Septum is midline, slightly deviated to the left.,THROAT:  There is clear postnasal drip.  Oral hygiene is good.  No masses or lesions noted.  Both vocal cords move well to midline.,NECK:  The neck is supple with no adenopathy or masses palpated.  The trachea is midline.  The thyroid gland is of normal size with no nodules.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheeze noted.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmur noted.,NEUROLOGIC:  Facial nerve is intact bilaterally.  The remaining cranial nerves are intact without focal deficit.,PROCEDURE: , Fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy identifying turbinate hypertrophy and nasal septum deviation to the left, more significant posteriorly.,IMPRESSION:  ,1.  Probable increasing problems with allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis, both contributing to the patient's symptoms.,2.  Subjective dizziness, etiology uncertain; however, consider positional vertigo versus vestibular neuronitis as possible ear causes of dizziness, cannot rule out systemic, central or medication or causes at this time.,3.  Inferior turbinate hypertrophy.,4.  Nasal septum deformity.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  An ENG was ordered to evaluate vestibular function.  She was placed on Veramyst nasal spray two sprays each nostril daily and even twice daily if symptoms are worsening.  A Medrol Dosepak was prescribed as directed.

Suspected mild stress-induced adrenal insufficiency.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , This very independent 79-year old had struggled with cough, fevers, weakness, and chills for the week prior to admission.  She was seen on multiple occasions at Urgent Care and in her physician's office.  Initial x-ray showed some mild diffuse patchy infiltrates.  She was first started on Avelox, but had a reaction, switched to Augmentin, which caused loose stools, and then three days prior to admission was given daily 1 g Rocephin and started on azithromycin.  Her O2 saturations drifted downward.  They were less than 88% when active; at rest, varied between 88% and 92%.  Decision was made because of failed outpatient treatment of pneumonia.  Her medical history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis.  She is on 20 mg of methotrexate every week as well as Remicade every eight weeks.  Her last dose of Remicade was in the month of June.  Hospital course was relatively unremarkable.  CT scan was performed and no specific focal pathology was seen.  Dr. X, pulmonologist was consulted.  He also was uncertain as to the exact etiology, but viral etiology was most highly suspected.  Because of her loose stools, C. difficile toxin was ordered, although that is pending at the time of discharge.  She was continued on Rocephin IV and azithromycin.  Her fever broke 18 hours prior to discharge, and O2 saturations improved, as did her overall strength and clinical status.  She was instructed to finish azithromycin.  She has two pills left at home.  She is to follow up with Dr. X in two to three days.  Because she is on chronic prednisone therapy, it was suspected that she was mildly adrenal insufficient from the stress of her pneumonia.  She is to continue the increased dose of prednisone at 20 mg (up from 5 mg per day).  We will consult her rheumatologist as to whether to continue her methotrexate, which we held this past Friday.  Methotrexate is known on some occasions to cause pneumonitis.\",\r",{"entities":[[30,33,"CARDINAL"],[34,43,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[74,76,"CARDINAL"],[78,85,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[87,89,"CARDINAL"],[91,111,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[134,136,"CARDINAL"],[138,156,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[175,177,"CARDINAL"],[179,186,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[188,190,"CARDINAL"],[192,212,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[214,216,"CARDINAL"],[228,269,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[312,323,"CARDINAL"],[343,348,"SYMPTOM"],[350,356,"SYMPTOM"],[358,366,"SYMPTOM"],[372,378,"SYMPTOM"],[383,397,"TIME"],[426,447,"TIME"],[503,508,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[521,552,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[580,586,"MEDICATION"],[598,606,"SYMPTOM"],[620,629,"MEDICATION"],[643,656,"SYMPTOM"],[667,684,"TIME"],[707,712,"TIME"],[713,716,"CARDINAL"],[717,725,"MEDICATION"],[741,753,"MEDICATION"],[760,774,"CARDINAL"],[814,818,"PERCENT"],[855,859,"PERCENT"],[863,866,"PERCENT"],[929,938,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[980,1000,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1013,1018,"CARDINAL"],[1022,1034,"MEDICATION"],[1035,1045,"TIME"],[1057,1065,"MEDICATION"],[1066,1083,"TIME"],[1103,1111,"MEDICATION"],[1115,1136,"DATE"],[1185,1193,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1223,1238,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1250,1255,"PERSON"],[1397,1409,"SYMPTOM"],[1411,1429,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1475,1492,"TIME"],[1516,1527,"MEDICATION"],[1532,1544,"MEDICATION"],[1563,1577,"TIME"],[1596,1610,"CARDINAL"],[1700,1712,"MEDICATION"],[1723,1733,"CARDINAL"],[1773,1778,"PERSON"],[1779,1799,"TIME"],[1820,1846,"MEDICATION"],[1878,1905,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1929,1938,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1982,1992,"MEDICATION"],[1996,2001,"CARDINAL"],[2011,2015,"CARDINAL"],[2016,2023,"TIME"],[2092,2104,"MEDICATION"],[2120,2136,"DATE"],[2139,2151,"MEDICATION"],[2188,2199,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"]]}],["        \"COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL STATUS EVALUATION,REASON FOR REFERRAL/GENERAL OBSERVATIONS:,  The patient was referred for a Comprehensive Mental Status Evaluation for the purpose of assisting in the determination of eligibility for Disability.

Have breakfast.  Take a shower about 8:30.  Do errands.  Me and my wife are out of the house by 9:00.  Check e-mail at the library.  I like the computer.  We have lunch 11:30 or 12:00.  Do errands or watch talk shows or I'll read.  I love to read.  Around 5:00 to 5:30, have supper.  Watch the news, game shows.  In bed by 10:00.\\\"  He will help with vacuuming, doing the dishes or yard work.  His wife does most of the house cleaning.  He does no cooking.  He and his wife get out every day usually for three or four hours.  He has a neighbor next door that he will see twice a week.  He used to go to the gym but has not been in a few weeks.  No other family contact was described and he does not go to church.  When asked what he enjoys he stated, \\\"read, use my computer or go ride my bike.\\\", ,MENTAL STATUS EVALUATION:,  On interview, the claimant looked his stated age of 43 years.  He was tall in stature and thin in weight.  He was neat and clean in appearance.  Posture was somewhat tense but psychomotor activity was not remarkable.  Eye contact was fleeting with fair social skills evident.  Facial expression was tense and affect was restricted with little animation noted.  General mood appeared dysphoric.  Speech was clear, coherent, logical, goal-directed and relevant.  He was cooperative in attitude toward the examiner.  He described his recent mood as, \\\"cloudy, gray because we've got a lot of personal problems right now.  I'm frustrated because I don't know where things are going.\\\"  He described some problems with falling asleep and staying asleep at night as well as decreased energy level.  He denied appetite disturbance.  He has lost interest in some activities suggesting mild anhedonia.  He has trouble with attention and concentration stating, \\\"I have trouble recalling how to do things on the computer. I've always been technically minded, but now it's harder.\\\"  He has thoughts of suicide about once or twice a week and has often fled situations in the past.  He stated, \\\"I try to keep myself from running away.\\\"  He denied any plan or intent for suicide.  He suggested significant anxiety problems as well.  He stated, \\\"I'm dealing with pedophilia.  I try to time it so that I don't go to a store with lots of people around.  If there is people I get real edgy, heart pounds, shortness of breath.  A lot of chest discomfort.\\\"  He has these panic symptoms quite regularly and they have occurred ever since 1997.  That was the time that he engaged in some type of sexual assault with a minor and spent about a week in jail.  No phobic processes were suggested.  No psychotic symptoms were revealed.  He denied hallucinations and no delusional material was elicited.  Thought content was appropriate to mood and circumstances.,The claimant was oriented in all spheres.  He evidenced adequate memory for both recent and remote events.  He was able to recall 3 of 3 words after a 1 minute and 10 minute delay.  Fair sustained attention and concentration skills were shown.  He was able to spell a word backward and performed a serial 7 subtraction task affectively.  Basic calculation skills were intact and no language-based dysfunction was noted.  Social judgment was also intact as he gave a good response to finding a wallet in the street, \\\"find who the owner was, bring it to the police station or contact the person,\\\" and to seeing smoke in a theater, \\\"Get a hold of staff so they could evacuate.\\\"  Adequate conceptual abilities was shown with similarity comparisons.  Somewhat limited abstraction was shown with proverb interpretation, glass houses, \\\"don't do anything you're not supposed to do.\\\"  Premorbid intellect is estimated to be at least in the average range.  Insight regarding his situation was fair.,DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION:,Axis I:  Major Depression, recurrent, moderate.  Panic disorder without agoraphobia.,SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS:,  Based on this evaluation, I believe the claimant's current condition would continue to result in difficulty with work-related activities.  He continues to show significant problems with depression and anxiety.  He is quite withdrawn and socially isolated and has panic attacks whenever he is confronted with public situations.  He relies on his wife to take care of most all household task.  He engages in very few simple, routine and repetitive activities. Cognitive capacity was relatively intact suggesting no significant problems in maintaining focus and pace with task.,RECOMMENDATIONS/CAPABILITY:,  The claimant was strongly encouraged to get some additional help for his emotional problems.  He would benefit from having someone to speak with on a regular basis and some referrals were offered. ,It is the opinion of this examiner that the claimant is capable of handling his own funds if so assigned.\",\r",{"entities":[[9,47,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[123,162,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[251,263,"CARDINAL"],[370,379,"TIME"],[432,436,"DATE"],[819,837,"SYMPTOM"],[840,865,"SYMPTOM"],[867,886,"SYMPTOM"],[897,907,"SYMPTOM"],[970,980,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[994,998,"DATE"],[1031,1044,"TIME"],[1079,1104,"LOC"],[1117,1127,"TIME"],[1163,1172,"SYMPTOM"],[1292,1313,"TIME"],[1433,1451,"SYMPTOM"],[1465,1469,"DATE"],[1497,1509,"TIME"],[1536,1552,"TIME"],[1595,1605,"DATE"],[1609,1625,"LOC"],[1635,1652,"SYMPTOM"],[1652,1664,"TIME"],[1676,1689,"SYMPTOM"],[1715,1740,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1744,1748,"DATE"],[1761,1771,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1984,1991,"MEDICATION"],[1992,1997,"CARDINAL"],[1998,2004,"TIME"],[2254,2262,"TIME"],[2279,2292,"LOC"],[2360,2381,"CARDINAL"],[2398,2416,"SYMPTOM"],[2581,2605,"SYMPTOM"],[2643,2651,"CARDINAL"],[2663,2680,"SYMPTOM"],[2712,2722,"CARDINAL"],[2727,2737,"TIME"],[2873,2889,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3028,3032,"DATE"],[3066,3075,"CARDINAL"],[3082,3090,"TIME"],[3100,3109,"TIME"],[3281,3293,"TIME"],[3333,3337,"TIME"],[3392,3396,"TIME"],[3465,3479,"TIME"],[3552,3564,"TIME"],[3619,3625,"TIME"],[3778,3787,"TIME"],[3800,3819,"TIME"],[3867,3879,"TIME"],[3924,3938,"TIME"],[4175,4183,"CARDINAL"],[4268,4294,"SYMPTOM"],[4341,4365,"SYMPTOM"],[4399,4427,"SYMPTOM"],[4432,4453,"SYMPTOM"],[4458,4481,"SYMPTOM"],[4492,4515,"SYMPTOM"],[4823,4870,"SYMPTOM"],[4871,4879,"TIME"],[4890,4913,"SYMPTOM"],[4926,4946,"SYMPTOM"],[4956,4988,"SYMPTOM"],[5000,5014,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[5024,5064,"SYMPTOM"],[5083,5117,"SYMPTOM"],[5203,5222,"SYMPTOM"],[5229,5249,"TIME"],[5364,5390,"SYMPTOM"],[5406,5434,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[5475,5485,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[5594,5598,"SYMPTOM"],[5600,5612,"SYMPTOM"],[5614,5633,"SYMPTOM"],[5645,5661,"SYMPTOM"],[5679,5693,"SYMPTOM"],[5700,5709,"TIME"],[5744,5748,"DATE"],[5838,5851,"TIME"],[5901,5920,"SYMPTOM"],[5947,5961,"SYMPTOM"],[5969,5979,"SYMPTOM"],[6192,6205,"CARDINAL"],[6214,6222,"TIME"],[6227,6236,"TIME"],[6368,6386,"CARDINAL"],[7090,7127,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[7130,7164,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[7379,7389,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[7394,7401,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[7416,7425,"SYMPTOM"],[7430,7448,"SYMPTOM"],[7456,7518,"SYMPTOM"],[7871,7889,"SYMPTOM"]]}],["        \"Thereafter, he was evaluated and it was felt that further reconstruction as related to the anterior cruciate ligament was definitely not indicated.

Large patulous anastomosis between posterior aspect of the left atrium and anterior aspect of the pulmonary venous confluence.  Nonobstructed ascending vein ligated.  Patent ductus arteriosus diminutive left atrium with posterior atrial septal defect with deficient inferior margin.  At completion of the procedure, right ventricular pressure approximating one-half of systemic, normal sinus rhythm, good biventricular function by visual inspection.,PROCEDURE: , After the informed consent, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating room table in supine position.  Upon induction of general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of indwelling arterial and venous monitoring lines.  The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion from chin to groins.  A median sternotomy incision was performed.  Dissection was carried through the deeper planes until the sternum was scored and divided with an oscillating saw.  A subtotal thymectomy was performed.  Systemic heparinization was achieved and the pericardium was entered and fashioned until cradle.  A small portion of the anterior pericardium was procured and fixed in glutaraldehyde for patch closure of segment of the atrial septal defect during the procedure.  Pursestrings were deployed on the ascending aorta on the right.  Atrial appendage.  The aorta was then cannulated with an 8-French aorta cannula and the right atrium with an 18-French Polystan right-angle cannula.  With an ACT greater than 400, greater pulmonary bypass was commenced with excellent cardiac decompression and the patent ductus arteriosus was ligated with a 2-0 silk tie.  Systemic cooling was started and the head was packed  and iced and systemic steroids were administered.  During cooling, traction suture was placed in the apex of the left ventricle.  After 25 minutes of cooling, the aorta was cross-clamped and the heart arrested by administration of 30 cubic centimeter/kilogram of cold-blood cardioplegia delivered directly within the aortic root following the aorta cross-clamping.  Following successful cardioplegic arrest, a period of low flow perfusion was started and a 10-French catheter was inserted into the right atrial appendage substituting the 18-French Polystan venous cannula.  The heart was then rotated to the right side and the venous confluence was exposed.  It was incised and enlarged and a corresponding incision in the dorsal and posterior aspect of the left atrium was performed.  The two openings were then anastomosed in an end-to-side fashion with several interlocking sutures to avoid pursestring effect with a running 7-0 PDS suture.  Following completion of the anastomosis, the heart was returned into the chest and the patient's blood volume was drained into the reservoir.  A right atriotomy was then performed during the period of circulatory arrest.  The atrial septal defect was very difficult to expose, but it was sealed with an autologous pericardial patch was secured in place with a running 6-0 Prolene suture.  The usual deairing maneuvers were carried out and lining was administered and the right atriotomy was closed in two layers with a running 6-0 Prolene sutures.  The venous cannula was reinserted.  Cardiopulmonary bypass restarted and the aorta cross-clamp was released.  The patient returned to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and started regaining satisfactory hemodynamics which, following a prolonged period of rewarming, allow for us to wean her from cardiopulmonary bypass successfully and moderate inotropic support and sinus rhythm.  Modified ultrafiltration was carried out and two sets of atrial and ventricular pacing wires were placed as well as the peritoneal dialysis catheter and two 15-French Blake drains.  Venous decannulation was followed by aortic decannulation and administration of protamine sulfate.  All cannulation sites were oversewn with 6-0 Prolene sutures and the anastomotic sites noticed to be hemostatic.  With good hemodynamics and hemostasis, the sternum was then smeared with vancomycin, placing closure with stainless steel wires.  The subcutaneous tissues were closed in layers with the reabsorbable monofilament sutures.  Sponge and needle counts were correct times 2 at the end of the procedure.  The patient was transferred in very stable condition to the pediatric intensive care unit .,I was the surgical attending present in the operating room and in charge of the surgical procedure throughout the entire length of the case.

Intravenous fluid administration.,4.  Heparin 3000 units IV.,INDICATIONS: , This 70-year-old Asian-American presents with chest pain syndrome, abnormal EKG suggesting an acute ST elevation, anterior myocardial infarction, being taken urgently to cardiac catheterization laboratory with possible coronary intervention.,NARRATIVE: , After detailed informed consent had been obtained.  Usual benefits, alternatives, and risks of the procedure had been discussed with the patient, she was agreeable to proceed.  The patient was prepped, draped, and anesthetized in the usual manner.  Using modified Seldinger technique a 6 French introducer sheath inserted into the right femoral artery.  Next, 6 French 3D right coronary catheter was inserted and right coronary angiogram was obtained in various projections.  Next, a 6 French JL4.0 left coronary catheter was inserted and left coronary angiogram was obtained in various projections.  Next, 4 French pigtail catheter was inserted into left ventricle under fluoroscopic guidance.  Left ventricular angiogram was performed.  Pre and post angiogram LVEDP, LV, and aortic pressures were obtained.  At the end of the procedure catheters were removed and the introducer sheath was secured.  The patient was admitted to the TCU in stable condition.,FINDINGS,HEMODYNAMICS,LEFT HEART PRESSURES:,  LVEDP of 5, left ventricular systolic pressure of 81, central aortic pressure systolic 70, diastolic 20.,LEFT VENTRICULOGRAPHY: , Left ventricular chamber size is normal.  The distal half of the anterior wall of the entire apex and the distal half of the inferior wall are completely akinetic with hypercontractility of the basilar segments of the anterior and inferior wall.  Calculated ejection fraction of 51%, which probably overestimates the overall effective ejection fraction.  No LV thrombus or mitral regurgitation present.,CORONARY ARTERIOGRAPHY,1.  ,RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY: , The RCA gives rise to a posterior descending artery and a small posterolateral branch.  Angiographically the right coronary artery is normal.,2.  ,LEFT MAIN ARTERY:,  The left main vessel is angiographically normal, bifurcates into left anterior descending artery and circumflex system.,3.  ,LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY: , The LAD gives rise to a normal complement of septal branches, diagonal branches, and extends around the apex.  Angiographically the mid left anterior descending artery and distal left anterior descending artery demonstrates systolic compression of the vessel lumen, consistent with myocardial bridging.  The degree of myocardial bridging appears moderate in the mid vessel and mild in the distal segment.  Otherwise, there is no evidence of atherosclerotic obstruction.,4.  ,CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY: , The circumflex gives rise to two large extremely tortuous marginal vessels that extend towards the apex.  Angiographically, the circumflex artery is normal.,CONCLUSION: , This is a 70-year-old female with above clinical and cardiovascular history, who has angiographic evidence of a large anterior apical and inferior apical wall motion abnormality with angiographically patent coronary arteries with two segments of myocardial bridging involving the mid and distal left anterior descending artery.  These angiographic findings are consistent with Takasubo syndrome, aka apical ballooning syndrome.

Difficulty breathing began last night.  He was taken to Emergency Department where he got some Xopenex, given a prescription for amoxicillin and discharged home.  They were home for about an hour when he began to get worse and they drove here to Children's Hospital.  He has a history of reactive airway disease.  He has been seen here twice in the last month on 10/04/2007 and 10/20/2007, both times with some wheezing.  He was diagnosed with pneumonia back on 06/12/2007 here in the Emergency Department but was not admitted at that time.  He has been on albuterol off and on over that period.  He has had fever overnight.  No vomiting, no diarrhea.  Increased work of breathing with retractions and audible wheezes noted and thus brought to the Emergency Department.  Normal urine output.  No rashes have been seen.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , As noted above.  No hospitalizations, surgeries, allergies.,MEDICATIONS: , Xopenex.,IMMUNIZATIONS:,  Up-to-date.,BIRTH HISTORY:,  The child was full term, no complications, home with mom.  No surgeries.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Negative.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , No smokers or pets in the home.  No ill contacts, no travel, no change in living condition.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , Ten are asked, all are negative, except as noted above.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Temp 37.1, pulse 158, respiratory rate 48, 84% on room air indicating hypoxia.,GENERAL:  The child is awake, alert, in moderate respiratory distress.,HEENT:  Pupils equal, round, reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  The TMs are clear.  The nares show some dry secretions.  Audible congestion and wheezing is noted.  Mucous membranes are dry.  Throat is clear.  No oral lesions noted.,NECK:  Supple without lymphadenopathy or masses.  Trachea is midline.,LUNGS:  Show inspiratory and expiratory wheezes in all fields.  Audible wheezes are noted.  There are intercostal and subcostal retractions and suprasternal muscle use is noted.,HEART:  Shows tachycardia.  Regular rhythm.  Normal S1, S2.  No murmur.,ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender.  Positive bowel sounds.  No guarding.  No rebound.  No hepatosplenomegaly.,EXTREMITIES:  Capillary refill is brisk.  Good distal pulses.,NEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Moves all 4 extremities equally and normally.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , The child has an IV placed.  I felt the child was dehydrated on examination.  We gave 20 mL/kg bolus of normal saline over one hour.  The child was given Solu-Medrol 2 mg/kg IV.  He was initially started on unit dose albuterol and Atrovent but high-dose albuterol for continuous nebulization was ordered.,A portable chest x-ray was done showing significant peribronchial thickening bilaterally.  Normal heart size.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  No evidence of focal pneumonia.  After 3 unit dose of albuterol/Atrovent breathing treatments, there was much better air exchange bilaterally but still with inspiratory/expiratory wheezes and high-dose continuous albuterol was started at that time.  The child was monitored closely while on high-dose albuterol and slowly showed improvement resulting in only expiratory wheezes after one hour.  The child's pulse ox on breathing treatments with 100% oxygen was 100%.  Respiratory rate remained about 40 to 44 breaths per minute indicating tachypnea.  The child's color improved with oxygen therapy, and the capillary refill was always less than 2 seconds.,The child has failed outpatient therapy at this time.  After 90 minutes of continuous albuterol treatment, the child still has expiratory wheezes throughout.  After I removed the oxygen, the pulse ox was down at 91% indicating hypoxia.  The child has a normal level of alertness; however, has not had any vomiting here.  I spoke with Dr. X, on call for hospitalist service.  She has come down and evaluated the patient.  We both feel that since this child had two ER visits this last month, one previous ER visit within the last 5 hours, we should admit the child for continued albuterol treatments, IV steroids, and asthma teaching for the family.  The child is admitted in a stable condition.,DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES:  ,Ruled out pneumothorax, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, croup.,TIME SPENT:  ,Critical care time outside billable procedures was 45 minutes with this patient.,IMPRESSION:  ,Status asthmaticus, hypoxia.,PLAN:  ,Admitted to Pediatrics.\",\r",{"entities":[[35,48,"CARDINAL"],[85,105,"SYMPTOM"],[108,128,"SYMPTOM"],[135,145,"TIME"],[203,210,"MEDICATION"],[237,248,"MEDICATION"],[296,303,"TIME"],[354,373,"LOC"],[396,419,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[444,467,"TIME"],[471,481,"DATE"],[486,496,"DATE"],[519,527,"SYMPTOM"],[552,561,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[570,580,"DATE"],[665,674,"MEDICATION"],[686,702,"TIME"],[716,721,"SYMPTOM"],[722,731,"TIME"],[737,745,"SYMPTOM"],[750,758,"SYMPTOM"],[761,788,"SYMPTOM"],[794,805,"SYMPTOM"],[810,826,"SYMPTOM"],[904,910,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[989,998,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1026,1033,"MEDICATION"],[1143,1152,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1313,1316,"CARDINAL"],[1405,1414,"CARDINAL"],[1416,1425,"CARDINAL"],[1427,1446,"CARDINAL"],[1448,1451,"PERCENT"],[1475,1482,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1524,1553,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1555,1560,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1563,1569,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1643,1646,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1663,1668,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1704,1714,"SYMPTOM"],[1719,1727,"SYMPTOM"],[1739,1755,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1766,1772,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1787,1799,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1807,1811,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1829,1844,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1848,1854,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1857,1864,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1877,1882,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1890,1924,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1941,1957,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1979,2016,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2021,2040,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2055,2060,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2069,2082,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2106,2113,"CARDINAL"],[2119,2125,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2127,2134,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2164,2169,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2209,2227,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2229,2240,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2304,2334,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2355,2366,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2458,2468,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2494,2502,"CARDINAL"],[2512,2525,"MEDICATION"],[2526,2539,"TIME"],[2562,2573,"MEDICATION"],[2574,2581,"CARDINAL"],[2625,2634,"MEDICATION"],[2639,2647,"MEDICATION"],[2662,2671,"MEDICATION"],[2676,2699,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2715,2735,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2765,2801,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2811,2816,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2839,2851,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2869,2884,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2893,2900,"CARDINAL"],[2908,2947,"MEDICATION"],[3011,3041,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3046,3077,"MEDICATION"],[3145,3165,"MEDICATION"],[3213,3231,"SYMPTOM"],[3231,3246,"TIME"],[3299,3303,"PERCENT"],[3315,3319,"PERCENT"],[3354,3370,"CARDINAL"],[3371,3381,"TIME"],[3393,3402,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3437,3451,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3499,3508,"TIME"],[3570,3581,"TIME"],[3596,3605,"MEDICATION"],[3637,3655,"SYMPTOM"],[3722,3725,"PERCENT"],[3737,3744,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3815,3823,"SYMPTOM"],[3844,3849,"PERSON"],[3983,3999,"TIME"],[4023,4046,"TIME"],[4078,4108,"MEDICATION"],[4110,4121,"MEDICATION"],[4127,4133,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[4241,4253,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[4255,4264,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[4266,4279,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[4281,4286,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[4353,4363,"TIME"],[4397,4415,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[4417,4424,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"]]}],["        \"OPERATION PERFORMED:,  Full mouth dental rehabilitation in the operative room under general anesthesia.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Severe dental caries.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.

She had a history of open heart surgery at 11 months' of age.  She presented with severe anterior caries with most likely dental extractions needed.  Due to her young age, I felt that she would be best served in the safety of the hospital operating room.  After consultation with the mother, she agreed to have her treated in the safety of the hospital operating room at Children's Hospital.,OPERATIVE PREPARATION:  ,This child was brought to Hospital Day Surgery and is accompanied by her mother.  There I met with them and discussed the needs of the child, types of restorations to be performed, the risks and benefits of the treatment as well as the options and alternatives of the treatment.  After all their questions and concerns were addressed, I gave the informed consent to proceed with the treatment.  The patient's history and physical examination was reviewed.  Once she was cleared by Anesthesia and the child was taken back to the operating room.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was placed on the surgical table in the usual supine position with all extremities protected.  Anesthesia was induced by mask.  The patient was then intubated with a nasal endotracheal tube and the tube was stabilized.  The head was wrapped and the eyes were taped shut for protection.  An angiocatheter was placed in the left hand and an IV was started.  The head and neck were draped with sterile towels, and the body was covered with a lead apron and sterile sheath.  A moist continuous throat pack was placed beyond the tonsillar pillars.  Plastic lip and cheek retractors were then placed.  Preoperative clinical photographs were taken.  Two posterior bitewing radiographs and two anterior periapical films were taken in the operating room with digital radiography.  After the radiographs were taken, the lead shield was removed.  Prophylaxis was then performed using prophy cup and fluoridated prophy paste.  The teeth were then rinsed well and the patient's oral cavity was suctioned clean.  Clinical and radiographic examinations followed and areas of decay were noted.  During the restorative phase, these areas of decay were entered into and removed.  Entry was made to the level of the dental-enamel junction and beyond as necessary to remove it.  Final caries was removed and was confirmed upon reaching hard, firm sounding dentin.  Teeth restored with amalgam had a dentin tubular seal placed prior to amalgam placement.  Non-restorable primary teeth would be extracted.,Upon conclusion of the restorative phase, the oral cavity was aspirated and found to be free of blood, mucus, and other debris.  The original treatment plan was verified with the actual treatment provided.  Postoperative clinical photographs were then taken.  The continuous gauze throat pack was removed with continuous suction with visualization.  Topical fluoride was then placed on the teeth.,At the end of the procedure, the child was undraped, extubated, and awakened in the operating room and taken to the recovery room breathing spontaneously with stable vital signs.,FINDINGS:  ,This young patient presented with mild generalized marginal gingivitis secondary to light generalized plaque accumulation and fair oral hygiene.  All primary teeth were present.  Dental caries were present on the following teeth:  Tooth D, E, F, and G caries on all surfaces; teeth J, lingual caries.  The remainder of her teeth and soft tissues were within normal limits.  The following restorations and procedures were performed:  Tooth D, E, F, and G were extracted and four sutures were placed one at each extraction site and tooth J lingual amalgam.,CONCLUSION:  ,The mother was informed of the completion of the procedure.  She was given a synopsis of the treatment provided as well as written and verbal instructions for postoperative care.  They will contact to my office in the event of immediate postoperative complications.  After full recovery, she was discharged from the recovery room in the care of her mother.\",\r",{"entities":[[32,64,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[93,111,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[139,159,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[186,188,"CARDINAL"],[189,210,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[212,214,"CARDINAL"],[216,236,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[306,313,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[317,327,"TIME"],[382,392,"DATE"],[416,434,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[438,455,"CARDINAL"],[477,499,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[517,535,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[766,785,"LOC"],[1462,1473,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1486,1516,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1540,1580,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1640,1644,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1680,1705,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1751,1755,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1760,1764,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1881,1887,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1915,1932,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1943,1946,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1951,1956,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1987,2031,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2034,2037,"CARDINAL"],[2038,2068,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2073,2076,"CARDINAL"],[2077,2102,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2141,2160,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2173,2184,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2227,2238,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2279,2303,"MEDICATION"],[2310,2315,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2355,2368,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2442,2456,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2506,2520,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2588,2610,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2727,2733,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2736,2763,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2770,2796,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2849,2854,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2921,2933,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3156,3162,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3225,3242,"MEDICATION"],[3325,3334,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3497,3534,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3546,3584,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3613,3626,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3642,3656,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3694,3714,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3715,3721,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3739,3746,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3747,3762,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3786,3791,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3796,3808,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3895,3931,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3936,3960,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3961,3964,"CARDINAL"],[3993,4016,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"]]}],["        \"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Right temporal lobe intracerebral hemorrhage.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.

This is considered as a life threatening admission with a hemorrhage in the temporal lobe extending into the frontal lobe and with significant mass effect.,The patient apparently became hemiplegic suddenly today.  She also had an episode of incoherence and loss of consciousness as well as loss of bowel/urine.,She was brought to Emergency Room where a CT of the brain showed that she had significant hemorrhage of the right temporal lobe extending into the external capsule and across into the frontal lobe.  There is significant mass effect.  There is mixed density in the parenchyma of the temporal lobe.,She was originally scheduled for elective craniotomy for biopsy of the temporal lobe to find out why she was having spontaneous hemorrhages.  However, this event triggered her family to bring her to the emergency room, and this is considered a life threatening admission now with a significant mass effect, and thus we will proceed directly today for evacuation of ICH as well as biopsy of the temporal lobe as well as the dura.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was anesthetized by the anesthesiology team.  Appropriate central line as well as arterial line, Foley catheter, TED, and SCDs were placed.  The patient was positioned supine with a three-point Mayfield head pin holder.  Her scalp was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  Her former incisional scar was barely and faintly noticed; however, through the same scalp scar, the same incision was made and extended slightly inferiorly.  The scalp was resected anteriorly.  The subdural scar was noted, and hemostasis was achieved using Bovie cautery.  The temporalis muscle was reflected along with the scalp in a subperiosteal manner, and the titanium plating system was then exposed.,The titanium plating system was then removed in its entirety.  The bone appeared to be quite fused in multiple points, and there were significant granulation tissue through the burr hole covers.,The granulation tissue was quite hemorrhagic, and hemostasis was achieved using bipolar cautery as well as Bovie cautery.,The bone flap was then removed using Leksell rongeur, and the underlying dura was inspected.  It was quite full.  The 4-0 sutures from the previous durotomy closure was inspected, and more of the inferior temporal bone was resected using high-speed drill in combination with Leksell rongeur.  The sphenoid wing was also resected using a high-speed drill as well as angled rongeur.,Hemostasis was achieved on the fresh bony edges using bone wax.  The dura pack-up stitches were noted around the periphery from the previous craniotomy.  This was left in place.,The microscope was then brought in to use for the remainder of the procedure until closure.  Using a #15 blade, a new durotomy was then made.  Then, the durotomy was carried out using Metzenbaum scissors, then reflected the dura anteriorly in a horseshoe manner, placed anteriorly, and this was done under the operating microscope.  The underlying brain was quite edematous.,Along the temporal lobe there was a stain of xanthochromia along the surface.  Thus a corticectomy was then accomplished using bipolar cautery, and the temporal lobe at this level and the middle temporal gyrus was entered.  The parenchyma of the brain did not appear normal.  It was quite vascular.  Furthermore, there was a hematoma mixed in with the brain itself.  Thus a core biopsy was then performed in the temporal tip.  The overlying dura was inspected and it was quite thickened, approximately 0.25 cm thick, and it was also highly vascular, and thus a big section of the dura was also trimmed using bipolar cautery followed by scissors, and several pieces of this vascularized dura was resected for pathology.  Furthermore, sample of the temporal lobe was cultured.,Hemostasis after evacuation of the intracerebral hematoma using controlled suction as well as significant biopsy of the overlying dura as well as intraparenchymal lesion was accomplished.  No attempt was made to enter into the sylvian fissure.  Once hemostasis was meticulously achieved, the brain was inspected.  It still was quite swollen, known that there was still hematoma in the parenchyma of the brain.  However, at this time it was felt that since there is no diagnosis made intraoperatively, we would need to stage this surgery further should it be needed once the diagnosis is confirmed.  DuraGen was then used for duraplasty because of the resected dura.  The bone flap was then repositioned using Lorenz plating system.  Then a medium Hemovac drain was placed in subdural space.  Temporalis muscle was approximated using 2-0 Vicryl.  The galea was then reapproximated using inverted 2-0 Vicryl.  The scalp was then reapproximated using staples.

She was counseled to undergo staging laparotomy.,FINDINGS:,  Examination under anesthesia revealed a small uterus with no nodularity.  During the laparotomy, the uterus was small, mobile, and did not show any evidence of extrauterine spread of disease.  Other abdominal viscera, including the diaphragm, liver, spleen, omentum, small and large bowel, and peritoneal surfaces, were palpably normal.  There was no evidence of residual neoplasm after removal of the uterus.  The uterus itself showed no serosal abnormalities and the tubes and ovaries were unremarkable in appearance.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the Operating Room with an IV in place.  Anesthesia was induced, after which she was examined, prepped and draped.,A vertical midline incision was made and fascia was divided.  The peritoneum was entered without difficulty and washings were obtained.  The abdomen was explored with findings as noted.  A Bookwalter retractor was placed and bowel was packed.  Clamps were placed on the broad ligament for traction.  The retroperitoneal spaces were opened by incising lateral and parallel to the infundibulopelvic ligament.  The round ligaments were isolated, divided, and ligated.  The peritoneum overlying the vesicouterine fold was incised to mobilize the bladder.,Retroperitoneal spaces were then opened, allowing exposure of pelvic vessels and ureters.  The infundibulopelvic ligaments were isolated, divided, and doubly ligated.  The uterine artery pedicles were skeletonized, clamped, divided, and suture ligated.  Additional pedicles were developed on each side of the cervix, after which tissue was divided and suture ligated.  When the base of the cervix was reached, the vagina was cross-clamped and divided, allowing removal of the uterus with attached tubes and ovaries.  Angle stitches of o-Vicryl were placed, incorporating the uterosacral ligaments and the vaginal vault was closed with interrupted figure-of-eight stitches.  The pelvis was irrigated and excellent hemostasis was noted.,Retractors were repositioned to allow exposure for lymphadenectomy.  Metzenbaum scissors were used to incise lymphatic tissues.  Borders of the pelvic node dissection included the common iliac bifurcation superiorly, the psoas muscle laterally, the cross-over of the deep circumflex iliac vein over the external iliac artery inferiorly, and the anterior division of the hypogastric artery medially.  The posterior border of dissection was the obturator nerve, which was carefully identified and preserved bilaterally.  Ligaclips were applied where necessary.  After the lymphadenectomy was performed bilaterally, excellent hemostasis was noted.,Retractors were again repositioned to allow exposure of para-aortic nodes.  Lymph node tissue was mobilized, Ligaclips were applied, and the tissue was excised.  The pelvis was again irrigated and excellent hemostasis was noted.  The bowel was run and no evidence of disease was seen.,All packs and retractors were removed and the abdominal wall was closed using a running Smead-Jones closure with #1 permanent monofilament suture.  Subcutaneous tissues were irrigated and a Jackson-Pratt drain was placed.  Scarpa's fascia was closed with a running stitch and skin was closed with a running subcuticular stitch.

She may have had a brief loss of consciousness at the time of the accident since shortly thereafter she had some blurred vision, which lasted about a week and then resolved.  Since that time she has had right low neck pain and left low back pain.  She has been extensively worked up and treated for this.  MRI of the C & T spine and LS spine has been normal.  She has improved significantly, but still complains of pain.  In June of this year she had different symptoms, which she feels are unrelated.  She had some chest pain and feeling of tightness in the left arm and leg and face.  By the next morning she had numbness around her lips on the left side and encompassing the whole left arm and leg.  Symptoms lasted for about two days and then resolved.  However, since that time she has had intermittent numbness in the left hand and leg.  The face numbness has completely resolved.  Symptoms are mild.  She denies any previous similar episodes.  She denies associated dizziness, vision changes incoordination, weakness, change in gait, or change in bowel or bladder function.  There is no associated headache.,Brief examination reveals normal motor examination with no pronator drift and no incoordination.  Normal gait.  Cranial nerves are intact.  Sensory examination reveals normal facial sensation.  She has normal and symmetrical light touch, temperature, and pinprick in the upper extremities.  In the lower extremities she has a feeling of dysesthesia in the lateral aspect of the left calf into the lateral aspect of the left foot.  In this area she has normal light touch and pinprick.  She describes it as a strange unusual sensation.,NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: , Motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response amplitudes, conduction velocities, and F-waves are normal in the left arm and leg.,NEEDLE EMG: , Needle EMG was performed in the left leg, lumbosacral paraspinal, right tibialis anterior, and right upper thoracic paraspinal muscles using a disposable concentric needle.  It revealed normal insertional activity, no spontaneous activity, and normal motor unit action potential form in all muscles tested.,IMPRESSION: , This electrical study is normal.  There is no evidence for peripheral neuropathy, entrapment neuropathy, plexopathy, or lumbosacral radiculopathy.  EMG was also performed in the right upper thoracic paraspinal where she has experienced a lot of pain since the motor vehicle accident.  This was normal.,Based on her history of sudden onset of left face, arm, and leg weakness as well as a normal EMG and MRI of her spine I am concerned that she had a central event in June of this year.  Symptoms are now very mild, but I have ordered an MRI of the brain with and without contrast and MRA of the head and neck with contrast to further elucidate her symptoms.

As you certainly know, he is now a 9-month-old male product of a twin gestation complicated by some very mild prematurity.  He has been having problems with wheezing, cough and shortness of breath over the last several months.  You and your partners have treated him aggressively with inhaled steroids and bronchodilator.  Despite this, however; he has had persistent problems with a cough and has been more recently started on both a short burst of prednisolone as well as a more prolonged alternating day course.  ,Although there is no smoke exposure there is a significant family history with both Abc's father and uncle having problems with asthma as well as his older sister.  The parents now maintain separate households and there has been a question about the consistency of his medication administration at his father's house.  ,On exam today, Abc had some scattered rhonchi which cleared with coughing but was otherwise healthy.  ,We spent the majority of our 45-minute just reviewing basic principles of asthma management and I believe that Abc's mother is fairly well versed in this.  I think the most important thing to realize is that Abc probably does have fairly severe childhood asthma and fortunately has avoided hospitalization.  ,I think it would be prudent to continue his alternate day steroids until he is completely symptom free on the days off steroids but it would be reasonable to continue to wean him down to as low as 1.5 milligrams (0.5 milliliters on alternate days).  I have encouraged his mother to contact our office so that we can answer questions if necessary by phone.,Thanks so much for allowing us to be involved in his care.  ,Sincerely,\",\r",{"entities":[[87,90,"PERSON"],[162,175,"CARDINAL"],[238,249,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[285,293,"SYMPTOM"],[295,300,"SYMPTOM"],[305,325,"SYMPTOM"],[333,353,"TIME"],[412,429,"MEDICATION"],[434,448,"MEDICATION"],[485,517,"SYMPTOM"],[578,590,"MEDICATION"],[729,734,"PERSON"],[773,779,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[980,983,"PERSON"],[993,1011,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1097,1106,"TIME"],[1179,1184,"PERSON"],[1276,1279,"PERSON"],[1305,1329,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1435,1443,"MEDICATION"],[1496,1504,"MEDICATION"],[1574,1588,"CARDINAL"],[1590,1605,"CARDINAL"]]}],["        \"PROCEDURE: , Right knee joint steroid injection.,PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Osteoarthritis of the right knee.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Osteoarthritis of the right knee.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was apprised of the risks and the benefits of the procedure and consented.

The patient was on vancomycin for the last 5 days.,BRIEF HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 53-year-old female who presented with Enterococcus urosepsis.  CT scan showed a lower pole stone with a stent in place.  The stent was placed about 2 months ago, but when patient came in with a possibly UPJ stone with fevers of unknown etiology.  The patient had a stent placed at that time due to the fevers, thinking that this was an urospetic stone.  There was some pus that came out.  The patient was cultured; actually it was negative at that time.  The patient subsequently was found to have lower extremity DVT and then was started on Coumadin.  The patient cannot be taken off Coumadin for the next 6 months due to the significant swelling and high risk for PE.  The repeat films were taken which showed the stone had migrated into the pole.,The stent was intact.  The patient subsequently developed recurrent UTIs and Enterococcus in the urine with fevers.  The patient was admitted for IV antibiotics since the patient could not really tolerate penicillin due to allergy and due to patient being on Coumadin, Cipro, and Levaquin where treatment was little bit more complicated.  Due to drug interaction, the patient was admitted for IV antibiotic treatment.  The thinking was that either the stone or the stent is infected, since the stone is pretty small in size, the stent is very likely possibility that it could have been infected and now it needs to be removed.  Since the stone is not obstructing, there is no reason to replace the stent at this time.  We are unable to do the ureteroscopy or the shock-wave lithotripsy when the patient is fully anticoagulated.  So, the best option at this time is to probably wait and perform the ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy when the patient is allowed to off her Coumadin, which would be probably about 4 months down the road.,Plan is to get rid of the stent and improve patient's urinary symptoms and to get rid of the infection and we will worry about the stone at later point.,DETAILS OF THE OR: , Consent had been obtained from the patient.  Risks, benefits, and options were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, and PE were discussed.  The patient understood all the risks and benefits of removing the stent and wanted to proceed.  The patient was brought to the OR.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient was given some IV pain meds.  The patient had received vancomycin and Levaquin preop.  Cystoscopy was performed using graspers.  The stent was removed without difficulty.

Proximal interphalangeal joint arthroplasty, bilateral fifth toes.,3.  Distal interphalangeal joint arthroplasty, bilateral third and fourth toes.,4.  Flexor tenotomy, bilateral third toes.,HISTORY:,  This is a 36-year-old female who presented to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping herself n.p.o. since mid night for surgery on her painful bunion to her right foot and her painful hammertoes to both feet.  The patient has a history of sharp pain, which is aggravated by wearing shoes and ambulation.  She has tried multiple conservative methods and treatment such as wide shoes and accommodative padding, all of which provided inadequate relief.  At this time, she desires attempted surgical correction.  The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been discussed in detail by Dr. Kaczander with the patient and the consent is available on the chart.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:,  After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with a safety strap placed across her waist for her protection.,Copious amounts of Webril were applied about both ankles and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over the Webril.  After adequate IV sedation was administered, a total of 18 cc of a 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to anesthetize the right foot, performing a Mayo block and a bilateral third, fourth, and fifth digital block.  Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion bilaterally.  The foot was elevated off the table and an Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the right foot.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated on the right foot to 200 mmHg.  The foot was lowered into operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected proximally.  Attention was directed to the right first metatarsophalangeal joint, it was found to be contracted and there was lateral deviation of the hallux.  There was decreased range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint.  A dorsolinear incision was made with a #10 blade, approximately 4 cm in length.  The incision was deepened to the subcutaneous layer with a #15 blade.  Any small veins traversing the subcutaneous layer were ligated with electrocautery.  Next, the medial and lateral wound margins were undermined sharply.  Care was taken to avoid the medial neurovascular bundle and the lateral extensor hallucis longus tendon.  Next, the first metatarsal joint capsule was identified.  A #15 blade was used to make a linear capsular incision down to the bone.  The capsular periosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a #15 blade and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound.  The PASA was found to be within normal limits.  There was a hypertrophic medial eminence noted.  A sagittal saw was used to remove the hypertrophic medial eminence.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was placed into the central medial aspect of the metatarsal head as an access guide.  A standard lateral release was performed.  The fibular sesamoid was found to be in the interspace, but was relocated onto the metatarsal head properly.  Next, a sagittal saw was used to perform a long arm Austin osteotomy.  The K-wire was removed.  The capital fragment was shifted laterally and impacted into the head.  A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was used to temporarily fixate the osteotomy.  A 2.7 x 16 mm Synthes, fully threaded cortical screw was throne using standard AO technique.  A second screw was throne, which was a 2.0 x 12 mm Synthes cortical screw.  Excellent fixation was achieved and the screws tightly perched the bone.  Next, the medial overhanging wedge was removed with a sagittal saw.  A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony prominences.  The 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was removed.  The screws were checked again for tightness and found to be very tight.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsular periosteal tissues with simple interrupted suture technique.  A #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer in a simple interrupted technique.  A #5-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin in a running subcuticular fashion.,Attention was directed to the right third digit, which was found to be markedly contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint.  A #15 blade was used to make two convergent semi-elliptical incisions over the distal interphalangeal joint.  The incision was deepened with a #15 blade.  The wedge of skin was removed in full thickness.  The long extensor tendon was identified and the distal and proximal borders of the wound were undermined.  The #15 blade was used to transect the long extensor tendon, which was reflected proximally.  The distal interphalangeal joint was identified and the #15 blade was placed in the joint and the medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released.  Crown and collar scissors were used to release the planar attachment to the head of the middle phalanx.  Next, a double action bone cutter was used to resect the head of the middle phalanx.  The toe was dorsiflexed and was found to have an excellent rectus position.  A hand rasp was used to smooth all bony surfaces.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline.  The flexor tendon was found to be contracted, therefore, a flexor tenotomy was performed through the dorsal incision.  Next, #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the long extensor tendon with two simple interrupted sutures.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin and excellent cosmetic result was achieved.,Attention was directed to the fourth toe, which was found to be contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint and abducted and varus rotated.  An oblique skin incision with two converging semi-elliptical incisions was created using #15 blade.  The rest of the procedure was repeated exactly the same as the above paragraph to the third toe on the right foot.  All the same suture materials were used.  However, there was no flexor tenotomy performed on this toe, only on the third toe bilaterally.,Attention was directed to the fifth right digit, which was found to be contracted at the proximal interphalangeal joint.  A linear incision approximately 2 cm in length was made with a #15 blade over the proximal interphalangeal joint.  Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous layer.  The medial and lateral margins were undermined sharply to the level of the long extensor tendon.  The proximal interphalangeal joint was identified and the tendon was transected with the #15 blade.  The tendon was reflected proximally, off the head of the proximal phalanx.  The medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound.  A double action bone nibbler was used to remove the head of the proximal phalanx.  A hand rasp was used to smooth residual bone.  The joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline.  A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the long extensor tendon with two simple interrupted sutures.  A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin with a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress sutures.,A standard postoperative dressing consisting of saline-soaked #0-1 silk, 4 x 4s, Kerlix, Kling, and Coban were applied.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.,Attention was directed to the left foot.  The foot was elevated off the table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 200 mmHg.  Attention was directed to the left fifth toe, which was found to be contracted at the proximal interphalangeal joint.  The exact same procedure, performed to the right fifth digit, was performed on this toe, with the same materials being used for suture and closure.,Attention was then directed to the left fourth digit, which was found to contracted and slightly abducted and varus rotated.  The exact same procedure as performed to the right fourth toe was performed, consisting of two semi-elliptical skin incisions in an oblique angle.  The same suture material were used to close the incision.,Attention was directed to the left third digit, which was found to be contracted at the distal interphalangeal joint.  The same procedure performed on the right third digit was also performed.  The same suture materials were used to close the wound and the flexor tenotomy was also performed at this digit.  A standard postoperative dressing was also applied to the left foot consisting of the same materials as described for the right foot.  The pneumatic tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits.  The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications.  She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the foot.  She was given postoperative shoes and will be partial weighbearing with crutches.  She was admitted short-stay to Dr. Kaczander for pain control.  She was placed on Demerol 50 and Vistaril 25 mg IM q3-4h. p.r.n. for pain.  She will have Vicodin 5/500 one to two p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. for moderate pain.  She was placed on Subq. heparin and given incentive spirometry 10 times an hour.  She will be discharged tomorrow.  She is to ice and elevate both feet today and rest as much as possible.,Physical Therapy will teach her crutch training today.  X-rays were taken in the postoperative area and revealed excellent position of the screws and correction of bunion deformity as well as the hammertoe deformities.\",\r",{"entities":[[33,35,"CARDINAL"],[37,69,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[71,73,"CARDINAL"],[75,125,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[152,154,"CARDINAL"],[156,189,"MEDICAL

Hospital Emergency Department on 08/30/2003 with history of acute abdominal pain.  On evaluation, it was noted that the patient has clinical findings consistent with acute appendicitis.  However, the patient with additional history of loose stools for several days prior to event.  Therefore, a CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained revealing findings consistent with acute appendicitis.  There was no evidence of colitis on the CAT scan.  With this in mind and the patient's continued pain at present, the patient was explained the risks and benefits of appendectomy.  She agreed to procedure and informed consent was obtained.,GROSS FINDINGS: , The appendix was removed without difficulty with laparoscopic approach.  The appendix itself noted to have a significant inflammation about it.  There was no evidence of perforation of the appendix.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:,  The patient was placed in supine position.  After appropriate anesthesia was obtained and sterile prep and drape completed, a #10 blade scalpel was used to make a curvilinear infraumbilical incision.  Through this incision, a Veress needle was utilized to create a CO2 pneumoperitoneum of 15 mmHg.  The Veress needle was then removed.  A 10 mm trocar was then introduced through this incision into the abdomen.  A video laparoscope was then inserted and the above noted gross findings were appreciated upon evaluation.  Initially, bilateral ovarian cysts were appreciated, however, there was no evidence of acute disease on evaluation.  Photodocumentation was obtained.,A 5 mm port was then placed in the right upper quadrant.  This was done under direct visualization and a blunt grasper was utilized to mobilize the appendix.  Next, a 12 mm port was placed in the left lower quadrant lateral to the rectus musculature under direct visualization.  Through this port, the dissector was utilized to create a small window in the mesoappendix.  Next, an EndoGIA with GI staples was utilized to fire across the base of the appendix, which was done noting it to be at the base of the appendix.  Next, staples were changed to vascular staples and the mesoappendix was then cut and vessels were then ligated with vascular staples.  Two 6 X-loupe wires with EndoGIA were utilized in this prior portion of the procedure.  Next, an EndoCatch was placed through the 12 mm port and the appendix was placed within it.  The appendix was then removed from the 12 mm port site and taken off the surgical site.  The 12 mm port was then placed back into the abdomen and CO2 pneumoperitoneum was recreated.  The base of the appendix was reevaluated and noted to be hemostatic.  Aspiration of warm saline irrigant then done and noted to be clear.  There was a small adhesion appreciated in the region of the surgical site.  This was taken down with blunt dissection without difficulty.  There was no evidence of other areas of disease.  Upon re-exploration with a video laparoscope in the abdomen and after this noting the appendix base to be hemostatic and intact.  The instruments were removed from the patient and the port sites were then taken off under direct visualization.  The CO2 pneumoperitoneum was released into the air and the fascia was approximated in the 10 mm and 12 mm port sites with #0 Vicryl ligature x2.  Marcaine 0.25% was then utilized in all three incision sites and #4-0 Vicryl suture was used to approximate the skin and all three incision sites.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.

A C5-C7 anterior cervical plate fixation (Sofamor Danek titanium window plate) intraoperative fluoroscopy used and intraoperative microscopy used.  Intraoperative SSEP and EMG monitoring used.,ANESTHESIA: , General endotracheal.,COMPLICATIONS:,  None.,INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE: , This lady presented with history of cervical pain associated with cervical radiculopathy with cervical and left arm pain, numbness, weakness, with MRI showing significant disk protrusions with the associate complexes at C5-C6 and C6-C7 with associated cervical radiculopathy.  After failure of conservative treatment, this patient elected to undergo surgery.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  ,The patient was brought to the OR and after adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, she was placed supine on the OR table with the head of the bed about 10 degrees.  A shoulder roll was placed and the head supported on a donut support.  The cervical region was prepped and draped in the standard fashion.  A transverse cervical incision was made from the midline, which was lateral to the medial edge of the sternocleidomastoid two fingerbreadths above the right clavicle.  In a transverse fashion, the incision was taken down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and through the platysmata and a subplatysmal dissection done.  Then, the dissection continued medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and then medial to the carotid artery to the prevertebral fascia, which was gently dissected and released superiorly and inferiorly.  Spinal needles were placed into the displaced C5-C6 and C6-C7 to confirm these disk levels using lateral fluoroscopy.  Following this, monopolar coagulation was used to dissect the medial edge of the longus colli muscles off the adjacent vertebrae between C5-C7 and then the Trimline retractors were placed to retract the longus colli muscles laterally and blunt retractors were placed superiorly and inferiorly.  A #15 scalpel was used to do a discectomy at C5-C6 from endplate-to-endplate and uncovertebral joint.  On the uncovertebral joint, a pituitary rongeur was used to empty out any disk material ____________ to further remove the disk material down to the posterior aspect.  This was done under the microscope.  A high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the endplates to the posterior aspect of the annulus.  A blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament and it was gently released using the #15 scalpel and then Kerrison punches 1-mm and then 2-mm were used to decompress further disk calcified material at the C5-C6 level.  This was done bilaterally to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent neuroforamen.  Then, at the C6-C7 level, in a similar fashion, #15 blade was used to do a discectomy from uncovertebral joint to uncovertebral joint and from endplate-to-endplate using a #15 scalpel to enter the disk space and then the curette was then used to remove the disk calcified material in the endplate, and then high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the disk space down to the posterior aspect of the annulus where a blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament which was gently released.  Then using the Kerrison punches, we used 1-mm and 2-mm, to remove disk calcified material, which was extending more posteriorly to the left and the right.  This was gently removed and decompressed to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent nerve roots.  With this done, the wound was irrigated.  Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation.  Vertebral body distraction pins were then placed to the vertebral body of C5 and C7 for vertebral distraction and then a 6-mm allograft performed grafts were taken and packed in either aspect with demineralized bone matrix and this was tapped in flush with the vertebral bodies above and below C5-C6 and C6-C7 discectomy sites.  Then, the vertebral body distraction pins were gently removed to allow for graft seating and compression and then the anterior cervical plate (Danek windows titanium plates) was then taken and sized and placed.  A temporary pin was initially used to align the plate and then keeping the position and then two screw holes were drilled in the vertebral body of C5, two in the vertebral body of C6, and two in the vertebral body of C7.  The holes were then drilled and after this self-tapping screws were placed into the vertebral body of C5, C6, and C7 across the plate to allow the plate to fit and stay flush with the vertebral body between C5, C6, and C7.  With this done, operative fluoroscopy was used to check good alignment of the graft, screw, and plate, and then the wound was irrigated.  Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation and then the locking screws were tightened down.  A #10 round Jackson-Pratt drain was placed into the prevertebral space and brought out from a separate stab wound skin incision site.  Then, the platysma was approximated using 2-0 Vicryl inverted interrupted stitches and the skin closed with 4-0 Vicryl running subcuticular stitch.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure.  Throughout the procedure, the microscope had been used for the disk decompression and high-speed drilling.  In addition, intraoperative SSEP, EMG monitoring, and motor-evoked potentials remained stable throughout the procedure.  The patient remained stable throughout the procedure.\",\r",{"entities":[[35,79,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[81,103,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[109,122,"SYMPTOM"],[151,195,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[197,219,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[224,238,"SYMPTOM"],[254,311,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[312,345,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[350,453,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[463,488,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[496,534,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[555,575,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[668,681,"SYMPTOM"],[698,720,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[726,752,"SYMPTOM"],[754,762,"SYMPTOM"],[764,772,"SYMPTOM"],[779,782,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[803,867,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[883,906,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[982,989,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1072,1103,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1174,1184,"CARDINAL"],[1262,1278,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1329,1357,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1376,1383,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1410,1448,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1449,1467,"CARDINAL"],[1478,1492,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1560,1564,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1569,1589,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1605,1615,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1622,1634,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1635,1645,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1663,1673,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1684,1724,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1734,1762,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1770,1789,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1808,1817,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1859,1885,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1895,1920,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1956,1975,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1994,2015,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2040,2079,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2097,2106,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2115,2121,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2181,2201,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2275,2278,"CARDINAL"],[2304,2373,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2383,2402,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2583,2620,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2665,2696,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2740,2771,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2809,2812,"CARDINAL"],[2847,2851,"CARDINAL"],[2861,2865,"CARDINAL"],[2879,2940,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2984,3040,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3056,3067,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3091,3094,"CARDINAL"],[3118,3128,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3134,3177,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3186,3207,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3215,3218,"CARDINAL"],[3240,3250,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3331,3339,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3350,3387,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3415,3419,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3438,3469,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3517,3548,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3618,3622,"CARDINAL"],[3627,3631,"CARDINAL"],[3643,3666,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3761,3773,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3787,3844,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3916,3936,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3939,3987,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3995,4023,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4026,4048,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[4060,4065,"CARDINAL"],[4065,4074,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[4150,4162,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4199,4248,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4249,4259,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[4278,4292,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4361,4372,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[4386,4441,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4573,4576,"CARDINAL"],[4608,4629,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4631,4634,"CARDINAL"],[4642,4662,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4668,4671,"CARDINAL"],[4679,4699,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4786,4818,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4886,4923,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4942,4964,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[5092,5111,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[5164,5167,"CARDINAL"],[5214,5233,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5307,5315,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5339,5350,"CARDINAL"],[5404,5416,"CARDINAL"],[5446,5458,"MEDICATION"],[5630,5649,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[5652,5672,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[5688,5707,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[5709,5723,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"]]}],["        \"CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Vomiting and nausea.,HPI: , The patient is a 52-year-old female who said she has had 1 week of nausea and vomiting, which is moderate-to-severe.

Lidocaine 1.5% for skin wheal was made 10 cm from the midline to the bilateral L2 distal vertebral body.  A 20-gauge, 15 cm SMK needle was then directed using AP and fluoroscopic guidance so that the tip of the needle was noted to be along the distal one-third and anterior border on the lateral view and on the AP view the tip of the needle was inside the lateral third of the border of the vertebral body.  At this time a negative motor stimulation was obtained.  Injection of 10 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plus 10 mg of Depo-Medrol was performed. Coagulation was then carried out for 90oC for 90 seconds.  At the conclusion of this, the needle under fluoroscopic guidance was withdrawn approximately 5 mm where again a negative motor stimulation was obtained and the sequence of injection and coagulation was repeated.  This was repeated one more time with a 5 mm withdrawal and coagulation.,At that time, attention was directed to the L3 body where the needle was placed to the upper one-third/distal two-thirds junction and the sequence of injection, coagulation, and negative motor stimulation with needle withdrawal one time of a 5 mm distance was repeated.

Operating microscope was used for both illumination and magnification.,FIRST ASSISTANT: , Nurse practitioner.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was placed in supine position.  The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for anterior discectomy and fusion.  An incision was made midline to the anterior body of the sternocleidomastoid at C5-C6 level.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and platysma muscle was divided exposing the carotid sheath, which was retracted laterally.  Trachea and esophagus were retracted medially.  After placing the self-retaining retractors with the longus colli muscles having been dissected away from the vertebral bodies at C5 and C6 and confirming our position with intraoperative x-rays, we then proceeded with the discectomy.,We then cleaned out the disc at C5-C6 after incising the annulus fibrosis.  We cleaned out the disc with a combination of angled and straight pituitary rongeurs and curettes, and the next step was to clean out the disc space totally.  With this having been done, we then turned our attention with the operating microscope to the osteophytes.  We drilled off the vertebral osteophytes at C5-C6, as well as the uncovertebral osteophytes.  This was removed along with the posterior longitudinal ligament.  After we had done this, the dural sac was opposed very nicely and both C6 nerve roots were thoroughly decompressed.  The next step after the decompression of the thecal sac and both C6 nerve roots was the fusion.  We observed that there was a ____________ in the posterior longitudinal ligament.  There was a free fragment disc, which had broken through the posterior longitudinal ligament just to the right of midline.,The next step was to obtain the bone from the back bone, using cortical cancellous graft 10 mm in size after we had estimated the size.  That was secured into place with distraction being applied on the vertebral bodies using vertebral body distractor.,After we had tapped in the bone plug, we then removed the distraction and the bone plug was fitting nicely.,We then use the Aesculap cervical titanium instrumentation with the 16-mm screws.  After securing the C5-C6 disc with four screws and titanium plate, x-rays showed good alignment of the spine, good placement of the bone graft, and after x-rays showed excellent position of the bone graft and instrumentation, we then placed in a Jackson-Pratt drain in the prevertebral space brought out through a separate incision.  The wound was closed with 2-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissues and skin was closed with Steri-Strips.  Blood loss during the operation was less than 10 mL.  No complications of the surgery.  Needle count, sponge count, and cottonoid count were correct.,\",\r",{"entities":[[35,67,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[96,128,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[143,184,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[197,265,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[268,288,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[449,453,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[502,532,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[571,626,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[633,637,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[639,658,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[664,679,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[705,719,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[753,760,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[765,774,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[853,874,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[910,940,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[974,995,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1024,1034,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1060,1073,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1093,1109,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1131,1135,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1250,1254,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1365,1376,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1398,1428,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1445,1470,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1505,1536,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1566,1577,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1610,1624,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1641,1653,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1680,1735,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1744,1750,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1802,1834,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1848,1866,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1897,1929,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1940,1957,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1991,1995,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2005,2014,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2022,2047,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2048,2053,"CARDINAL"],[2162,2179,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2185,2210,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2336,2378,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2388,2394,"CARDINAL"],[2422,2432,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2438,2442,"CARDINAL"],[2454,2476,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2506,2511,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2535,2539,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2557,2563,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2597,2601,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2612,2627,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2676,2694,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2763,2774,"CARDINAL"],[2778,2799,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2803,2807,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2824,2836,"MEDICATION"],[2885,2890,"CARDINAL"],[2917,2924,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"]]}],["        \"HISTORY:,  I had the pleasure of meeting and evaluating the patient referred today for evaluation and treatment of chronic sinusitis.  As you are well aware, she is a pleasant 50-year-old female who states she started having severe sinusitis about two to three months ago with facial discomfort, nasal congestion, eye pain, and postnasal drip symptoms.  She states she really has sinus problems, but this infection has been rather severe and she notes she has not had much improvement with antibiotics.  She had a CT of her paranasal sinuses identifying mild mucosal thickening of right paranasal sinuses with occlusion of the ostiomeatal complex on the right and turbinate hypertrophy was also noted when I reviewed the films and there is some minimal nasal septum deviation to the left.  She currently is not taking any medication for her sinuses.  She also has noted that she is having some problems with her balance and possible hearing loss or at least ear popping and fullness.  Her audiogram today demonstrated mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss, normal tympanometry, and normal speech discrimination.  She has tried topical nasal corticosteroid therapy without much improvement.  She tried Allegra without much improvement and she believes the Allegra may have caused problems with balance to worsen.  She notes her dizziness to be much worse if she does quick positional changes such as head turning or sudden movements, no ear fullness, pressure, humming, buzzing or roaring noted in her ears.  She denies any previous history of sinus surgery or nasal injury.  She believes she has some degree of allergy symptoms.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,Seasonal allergies, possible food allergies, chronic sinusitis, hypertension and history of weight change.  She is currently 180 pounds.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:,  Lower extremity vein stripping, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Strong for heart disease and alcoholism.,CURRENT MEDICATIONS: , DynaCirc.,ALLERGIES: , Egg-based products cause hives.,SOCIAL HISTORY:  ,The patient used to smoke cigarettes for about 20 years, one-half pack a day.  She currently does not, which was encouraged to continue.  She rarely drinks any alcohol-containing beverages.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: ,VITAL SIGNS:  Age 50, blood pressure is 136/74, pulse 84, temperature is 98.4, weight is 180 pounds, and height is 5 feet 3 inches.,GENERAL:  The patient is healthy appearing; alert and oriented to person, place and time; responds appropriately; in no acute distress.,HEAD:  Normocephalic.  No masses or lesions noted.,FACE:  No facial tenderness or asymmetry noted.,EYES:  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation bilaterally.  Extraocular movements are intact bilaterally.  No nystagmus.,EARS:  During Hallpike examination, the patient did not become dizzy until she would be placed back into sitting in the upright position.  No nystagmus was appreciated; however, the patient did subjectively report dizziness, which was repeated twice.  No evidence of any orthostatic hypotension was noted during the exam.  Tympanic membranes were noted to be intact.  No signs of middle ear effusion or ear canal inflammation.,NOSE:  The patient appears congested.  Turbinate hypertrophy is noted.  There are no signs of any acute sinusitis.  Septum is midline, slightly deviated to the left.,THROAT:  There is clear postnasal drip.  Oral hygiene is good.  No masses or lesions noted.  Both vocal cords move well to midline.,NECK:  The neck is supple with no adenopathy or masses palpated.  The trachea is midline.  The thyroid gland is of normal size with no nodules.,LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheeze noted.,HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmur noted.,NEUROLOGIC:  Facial nerve is intact bilaterally.  The remaining cranial nerves are intact without focal deficit.,PROCEDURE: , Fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy identifying turbinate hypertrophy and nasal septum deviation to the left, more significant posteriorly.,IMPRESSION:  ,1.  Probable increasing problems with allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis, both contributing to the patient's symptoms.,2.  Subjective dizziness, etiology uncertain; however, consider positional vertigo versus vestibular neuronitis as possible ear causes of dizziness, cannot rule out systemic, central or medication or causes at this time.,3.  Inferior turbinate hypertrophy.,4.  Nasal septum deformity.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  An ENG was ordered to evaluate vestibular function.  She was placed on Veramyst nasal spray two sprays each nostril daily and even twice daily if symptoms are worsening.  A Medrol Dosepak was prescribed as directed.  The patient was given instruction on use of nasal saline irrigation to be used twice daily and Clarinex 5 mg daily was recommended.  After the patients' ENG examination, we will see the patient back for further evaluation and treatment recommendations.  In light of the patient's atypical dizziness symptoms, I cannot rule out other pathology at this time, and I informed her if there are any acute changes or problems with regards to her balance or any other acute changes, which she attributes associated with her dizziness, she most likely should pursue an emergent visit to the emergency room.,Thank you for allowing me to participate with the care of your patient.\",\r",{"entities":[[86,91,"DATE"],[124,141,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[185,197,"CARDINAL"],[234,250,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[257,280,"TIME"],[286,303,"SYMPTOM"],[305,321,"SYMPTOM"],[323,331,"SYMPTOM"],[337,351,"SYMPTOM"],[389,403,"SYMPTOM"],[414,423,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[469,510,"SYMPTOM"],[523,550,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[563,587,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[590,613,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[619,655,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[673,694,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[754,784,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[850,857,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[903,928,"SYMPTOM"],[942,954,"SYMPTOM"],[967,991,"SYMPTOM"],[998,1007,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1027,1073,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1082,1094,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1145,1181,"MEDICATION"],[1219,1226,"MEDICATION"],[1273,1280,"MEDICATION"],[1345,1408,"SYMPTOM"],[1454,1467,"SYMPTOM"],[1468,1476,"SYMPTOM"],[1478,1485,"SYMPTOM"],[1487,1494,"SYMPTOM"],[1498,1505,"SYMPTOM"],[1561,1574,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1578,1590,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1629,1645,"SYMPTOM"],[1671,1689,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1700,1714,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1716,1733,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1735,1747,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1796,1806,"CARDINAL"],[1833,1863,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1865,1878,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1883,1896,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1927,1941,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1945,1955,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1980,1988,"MEDICATION"],[2028,2033,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2099,2108,"TIME"],[2110,2129,"CARDINAL"],[2243,2263,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2284,2286,"CARDINAL"],[2306,2312,"CARDINAL"],[2320,2322,"CARDINAL"],[2339,2343,"CARDINAL"],[2355,2358,"CARDINAL"],[2381,2396,"CARDINAL"],[2518,2532,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2534,2538,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2560,2566,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2570,2577,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2585,2589,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2595,2612,"SYMPTOM"],[2633,2637,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2640,2646,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2768,2777,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2779,2783,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2793,2813,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2842,2847,"SYMPTOM"],[2921,2930,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2993,3002,"SYMPTOM"],[3023,3028,"CARDINAL"],[3050,3074,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3102,3121,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3159,3178,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3182,3204,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3206,3210,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3233,3242,"SYMPTOM"],[3245,3266,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3304,3319,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3322,3328,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3372,3378,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3395,3410,"SYMPTOM"],[3439,3445,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3449,3456,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3470,3481,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3504,3508,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3538,3548,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3552,3558,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3574,3581,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3599,3612,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3639,3646,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3648,3653,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3695,3701,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3709,3714,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3746,3752,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3760,3770,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3773,3785,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3824,3839,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3858,3871,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3886,3914,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3927,3948,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3953,3987,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[4033,4035,"CARDINAL"],[4071,4088,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[4093,4110,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[4157,4159,"CARDINAL"],[4172,4181,"SYMPTOM"],[4221,4239,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[4246,4268,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[4295,4304,"SYMPTOM"],[4378,4380,"CARDINAL"],[4382,4412,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[4414,4416,"CARDINAL"],[4418,4440,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[4464,4467,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[4532,4552,"MEDICATION"],[4553,4556,"CARDINAL"],[4569,4576,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4577,4582,"TIME"],[4591,4603,"TIME"],[4634,4648,"MEDICATION"],[4722,4745,"MEDICATION"],[4756,4768,"TIME"],[4773,4781,"MEDICATION"],[4782,4786,"CARDINAL"],[4787,4792,"TIME"],[4831,4846,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[4967,4976,"SYMPTOM"],[5071,5084,"SYMPTOM"],[5088,5124,"SYMPTOM"],[5137,5151,"SYMPTOM"],[5194,5203,"SYMPTOM"]]}],["        \"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.

A 2-0 Vicryl, 3-0 Vicryl, 4-0 Vicryl, and 5-0 nylon.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,SPECIMENS: , None.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:,  Minimal.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the usual supine position.  At this time, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was placed on the patient's right ankle for the purpose of maintaining hemostasis.  Number of the anesthesias was obtained and then induced mild sedation and local anesthetic as described above was infiltrated about the surgical site.  The right foot was then scrubbed, prepped, and draped in the usual aseptic manner.  An Esmarch bandage was then used to exsanguinate the patient's right foot, and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet inflated to 200 mmHg.  Attention was then directed to dorsal aspect of the first metatarsophalangeal joint where a linear longitudinal incision measuring approximately a 3.5 cm in length was made.  The incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections.  All major neurovascular structures were avoided.  At this time, through the original skin incision, attention was directed to the first intermetatarsal space where utilizing both sharp and blunt dissection the deep transverse intermetatarsal ligament was identified.  This was then incised fully exposing the tendon and the abductor hallucis muscle.  This was then resected from his osseous attachments and a small tenotomy was performed.  At this time, a small lateral capsulotomy was also performed.  Lateral contractures were once again reevaluated and noted to be grossly reduced.,Attention was then directed to the dorsal aspect of the first metatarsal phalangeal joint where linear longitudinal and periosteal and capsular incisions were made following the first metatarsal joint and following the original shape of the skin incision.  The periosteal capsular layers were then reflected both medially and laterally from the head of the first metatarsal and a utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the head of the first metatarsal and medial eminence was resected and passed from the operative field.  A 0.045 inch K-wire was then driven across the first metatarsal head in order to act as an access dye.  The patient was then placed in the frog-leg position, and two osteotomy cuts were made, one from the access guide to the plantar proximal position and one from the access guide to the dorsal proximal position.  The dorsal arm was made longer than the plantar arm to accommodate for fixation.  At this time, the capital fragment was resected and shifted laterally into a more corrected position.  At this time, three portions of the 0.045-inch K-wire were placed across the osteotomy site in order to access temporary forms of fixation.  Two of the three of these K-wires were removed in sequence and following the standard AO technique two 3.4 x 15 mm and one 2.4 x 14 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screws were placed across the osteotomy site.  Compression was noted to be excellent.  All guide wires and 0.045-inch K-wires were then removed.  Utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the medial side of the first metatarsal was resected and passed from the operating field.  The wound was then once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline.  At this time, utilizing both 2-0 and 3-0 Vicryl, the periosteal and capsular layers were then reapproximated.  At this time, the skin was then closed in layers utilizing 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 nylon.  At this time, attention was directed to the dorsal aspect of the right fifth metatarsal where a linear longitudinal incision was made over the metatarsophalangeal joint just lateral to the extensor digitorum longus tension.  Incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections and all major neurovascular structures were avoided.,A periosteal and capsular incision was then made on the lateral aspect of the extensor digitorum longus tendon and periosteum and capsular layers were then reflected medially and laterally from the head of the fifth metatarsal.  Utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the lateral eminence was resected and passed from the operative field.  Utilizing the sagittal saw, a Weil-type osteotomy was made at the fifth metatarsal head.  The head was then shifted medially into a more corrected position.  A 0.045-inch K-wire was then used as a temporary fixation, and a 2.0 x 10 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screw was placed across the osteotomy site.  This was noted to be in correct position and compression was noted to be excellent.  Utilizing a small bone rongeur, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the dorsal aspect of the fifth metatarsal was resected and passed from the operative field.  The wound was once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline.  The periosteal and capsular layers were reapproximated utilizing 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin was then closed utilizing 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 nylon.  At this time, 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1 mL of dexamethasone phosphate were infiltrated about the surgical site.  The right foot was then dressed with Xeroform gauze, fluffs, Kling, and Ace wrap, all applied in mild compressive fashion.  The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then deflated and a prompt hyperemic response was noted to all digits of the right foot.  The patient was then transported from the operating room to the recovery room with vital sings stable and neurovascular status grossly intact to the right foot.  After a brief period of postoperative monitoring, the patient was discharged to home with proper written and verbal discharge instructions, which included to keep dressing clean, dry, and intact and to follow up with Dr. A.  The patient is to be nonweightbearing to the right foot.  The patient was given a prescription for pain medications on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and was educated on these.  The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well.  Dr. A was present throughout the entire case.\",\r",{"entities":[[33,35,"CARDINAL"],[37,79,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[81,83,"CARDINAL"],[85,120,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[147,149,"CARDINAL"],[150,193,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[195,197,"CARDINAL"],[199,234,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[260,322,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[338,352,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[374,379,"CARDINAL"],[383,387,"PERCENT"],[388,402,"MEDICATION"],[448,456,"CARDINAL"],[475,480,"CARDINAL"],[484,489,"PERCENT"],[489,503,"MEDICATION"],[508,512,"CARDINAL"],[515,539,"MEDICATION"],[555,579,"CARDINAL"],[585,596,"CARDINAL"],[630,640,"CARDINAL"],[642,652,"CARDINAL"],[654,664,"CARDINAL"],[670,679,"CARDINAL"],[961,973,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1065,1108,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1173,1183,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1315,1326,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1375,1383,"CARDINAL"],[1417,1469,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1478,1507,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1533,1539,"CARDINAL"],[1640,1670,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1686,1698,"TIME"],[1721,1725,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1765,1793,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1846,1887,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1945,1951,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1959,1984,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2019,2038,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2051,2059,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2098,2118,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2139,2159,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2256,2311,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2398,2421,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2462,2466,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2482,2508,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2566,2595,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2640,2668,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2673,2689,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2742,2752,"CARDINAL"],[2787,2808,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2906,2915,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2965,2990,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3028,3052,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3059,3069,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3095,3106,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3137,3149,"TIME"],[3240,3252,"TIME"],[3254,3269,"CARDINAL"],[3276,3286,"CARDINAL"],[3317,3326,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3381,3397,"CARDINAL"],[3480,3495,"CARDINAL"],[3500,3515,"CARDINAL"],[3569,3578,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3646,3657,"CARDINAL"],[3749,3753,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3761,3796,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3910,3931,"MEDICATION"],[3934,3946,"TIME"],[3963,3981,"CARDINAL"],[3987,3997,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4002,4017,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4063,4067,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4104,4114,"CARDINAL"],[4119,4128,"CARDINAL"],[4131,4143,"TIME"],[4175,4218,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4227,4255,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[4274,4299,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4304,4353,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4433,4463,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4480,4513,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[4555,4588,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4593,4603,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4608,4624,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4676,4704,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4745,4762,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4844,4863,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[4879,4901,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4908,4912,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4973,4984,"CARDINAL"],[5037,5048,"CARDINAL"],[5100,5109,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[5263,5267,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5275,5313,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5421,5442,"MEDICATION"],[5449,5479,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5510,5520,"CARDINAL"],[5530,5534,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5561,5571,"CARDINAL"],[5576,5585,"CARDINAL"],[5602,5607,"CARDINAL"],[5611,5615,"PERCENT"],[5616,5631,"MEDICATION"],[5635,5639,"CARDINAL"],[5643,5667,"MEDICATION"],[5713,5724,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5932,5956,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[6108,6118,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[6121,6141,"TIME"],[6338,6343,"PERSON"],[6391,6401,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[6445,6501,"MEDICATION"],[6588,6593,"PERSON"]]}],["        \"CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Status epilepticus.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a 6-year-old male who is a former 27-week premature infant who suffered an intraventricular hemorrhage requiring shunt placement, and as a result, has developmental delay and left hemiparesis.  At baseline, he can put about 2 to 4 words together in brief sentences.  His speech is not always easily understood; however, he is in a special education classroom in kindergarten.  He ambulates independently, but falls often.  He has difficulty with his left side compared to the right, and prefers to use the right upper extremity more than the left.  Mother reports he postures the left upper extremity when running.  He is being followed by Medical Therapy Unit and has also been seen in the past by Dr. X.  He has not received Botox or any other interventions with regard to his cerebral palsy.,The patient did require one shunt revision, but since then his shunt has done well.,The patient developed seizures about 2 years ago.  These occurred periodically, but they are always in the same and with the involvement of the left side more than right and he had an eye deviation forcefully to the left side.  His events, however, always tend to be prolonged.  He has had seizures as long as an hour and a half.  He tends to require multiple medications to stop them.  He has been followed by Dr. Y and was started on Trileptal.  At one point, The patient was taken off his medication for presumed failure to prevent his seizures.  He was more recently placed on Topamax since March 2007.  His last seizures were in March and May respectively.  He is worked up to a dose of 25 mg capsules, 2 capsules twice a day or about 5 mg/kg/day at this point.,The patient was in his usual state of health until early this morning and was noted to be in seizure.  His seizure this morning was similar to the previous seizures with forced deviation of his head and eyes to the left side and convulsion more on the left side than the right.  Family administered Diastat 7.5 mg x1 dose.  They did not know they could repeat this dose.  EMS was called and he received lorazepam 2 mg and then in the emergency department, 15 mg/kg of fosphenytoin.  His seizures stopped thereafter, since that time, he had gradually become more alert and is eating, and is nearly back to baseline.  He is a bit off balance and tends to be a bit weaker on the left side compared to baseline postictally.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , At this time, he is positive for a low-grade fever, he has had no signs of illness otherwise.  He does have some fevers after his prolonged seizures.  He denies any respiratory or cardiovascular complaints.  There is no numbness or loss of skills.  He has no rashes, arthritis or arthralgias.  He has no oropharyngeal complaints.  Visual or auditory complaints.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , Also positive for some mild scoliosis.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient lives at home with mother, father, and 2 other siblings.  There are no ill contacts.,FAMILY HISTORY: , Noncontributory.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,GENERAL:  The patient is a well-nourished, well-hydrated male, in no acute distress.,VITAL SIGNS:  His vital signs are stable and he is currently afebrile.,HEENT:  Atraumatic and normocephalic.  Oropharynx shows no lesions.,NECK:  Supple without adenopathy.,CHEST:  Clear to auscultation.,CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.,ABDOMEN:  Benign without organomegaly.,EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.,NEUROLOGIC:  The patient is alert and will follow instructions.  His speech is very dysarthric and he tends to run his words together.  He is about 50% understandable at best.  He does put words and sentences together.  His cranial nerves reveal his pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  His extraocular movements are intact.  His visual fields are full.  Disks are sharp bilaterally.  His face shows left facial weakness postictally.  His palate elevates midline.  Vision is intact bilaterally.  Tongue protrudes midline.,Motor exam reveals clearly decreased strength on the left side at baseline.  His left thigh is abducted at the hip at rest with the right thigh and leg straight.  He has difficulty using the left arm and while reaching for objects, shows exaggerated tremor/dysmetria.  Right upper extremity is much more on target.  His sensations are intact to light touch bilaterally.  Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric.  When sitting up, he shows some truncal instability and tendency towards decreased truncal tone and kyphosis.  He also shows some scoliotic curve of the spine, which is mild at this point.  Gait was not tested today.,IMPRESSION: , This is a 6-year-old male with recurrent status epilepticus, left hemiparesis, history of prematurity, and intraventricular hemorrhage.  He is on Topamax, which is at a moderate dose of 5 mg/kg a day or 50 mg twice a day.  At this point, it is not clear whether this medication will protect him or not, but the dose is clearly not at maximum, and he is tolerating the dose currently.  The plan will be to increase him up to 50 mg in the morning, and 75 mg at night for 2 weeks, and then 75 mg twice daily.  Reviewed the possible side effects of higher doses of Topamax, they will monitor him for language issues, cognitive problems or excessive somnolence.  I also discussed his imaging studies, which showed significant destruction of the cerebellum compared to other areas and despite this, the patient at baseline has a reasonable balance.  The plan from CT standpoint is to continue stretching program, continue with medical therapy unit.  He may benefit from Botox.,In addition, I reviewed the Diastat protocol with parents and given the patient tends to go into status epilepticus each time, they can administer Diastat immediately and not wait the standard 2 minutes or even 5 minutes that they were waiting before.

There were no adnexal masses appreciated.  The vulva and perineum appeared normal.  Laparoscopic findings revealed normal appearing uterus, fallopian tubes bilaterally as well as ovaries bilaterally.  There was a functional cyst on the left ovary.  There was filmy adhesion in the left pelvic sidewall.  There were two clear lesions consistent with endometriosis, one was on the right fallopian tube and the other one was in the cul-de-sac.  The uterosacrals and ovarian fossa as well as vesicouterine peritoneum were free of any endometriosis.  The liver was visualized and appeared normal.

She recently had a spontaneous vaginal delivery in June and her family planning is complete.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , After informed consent was obtained in layman's terms, the patient was taken back to the operating suite and placed under general anesthesia.  She was then prepped and draped and placed in the dorsal lithotomy position.  A bimanual exam was performed and the above findings were noted.  Prior to beginning the procedure, her bladder was drained with a red Robinson catheter.  A weighted speculum was placed in the patient's posterior vagina and the 12 o' clock position of the cervix was grasped with a single-toothed tenaculum.  The cervix was dilated so that the uterine elevator could be placed.  Gloves were exchanged and attention was then turned to the anterior abdominal wall where the skin at the umbilicus was everted and using the towel clips, a 1 cm infraumbilical skin incision was made.  The Veress needle was then inserted and using sterile saline ______ the pelvic cavity.  The abdomen was then insufflated with appropriate volume and flow of CO2.  The #11 bladed trocar was then placed and intraabdominal placement was confirmed with the laparoscope.  A second skin incision was made approximately 2 cm above the pubic symphysis and under direct visualization, a 7 mm bladed trocar was placed without difficulty.  Using the Hulka clip applicator, the left fallopian tube was identified, followed out to its fimbriated end and the Hulka clip was then placed snugly against the uterus across the entire diameter of the fallopian tube.  A second Hulka clip was then placed across the entire diameter just proximal to this.  There was good hemostasis at the fallopian tube.  The right fallopian tube was then identified and followed out to its fimbriated end and the Hulka clip was placed. snugly against the uterus across the entire portion of the fallopian tube in a 90 degree angle.  A second Hulka clip was placed just distal to this again across the entire diameter.  Good hemostasis was obtained.  At this point, the abdomen was desufflated and after it was desufflated, the suprapubic port site was visualized and found to be hemostatic.  The laparoscope and remaining trocars were then removed with good visualization of the peritoneum and fascia and the laparoscope was removed.  The umbilical incision was then closed with two interrupted #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  The suprapubic incision was then closed with Steri-Strips.  The uterine elevator was removed and the single-toothed tenaculum site was found to be hemostatic.  The patient tolerated that procedure well.  The sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct x2.

Following induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepared for surgery.  Table was turned.  The right shoulder roll was placed.  The head was turned to the left and rested on a doughnut.  The scalp was shaved, and then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  Incisions were marked along a putative right frontotemporal craniotomy frontally and over the parietal boss.  The parietal boss incision was opened.  It was about an inch and a half in length.  It was carried down to the skull.  Self-retaining retractor was placed.  A bur hole was now fashioned with the perforator.  This was widened with a 2-mm Kerrison punch.  The dura was now coagulated with bipolar electrocautery.  It was opened in a cruciate-type fashion.  The dural edges were coagulated back to the bony edges.  There was egress of a large amount of liquid.  Under pressure, we irrigated for quite sometime until irrigation was returning mostly clear.  A subdural drain was now inserted under direct vision into the subdural space and brought out through a separate stab incision.  It was secured with a 3-0 nylon suture.

He sustained a blunt trauma to his ribs resulting in multiple fractures and presumably also struck his mandible resulting in the above-mentioned fracture.  He was admitted to hospital in Harleton, Texas, where his initial evaluation showed the rib fractures have also showed a nodule on his right upper lobe as well as a mediastinal mass.  His mandible fracture was not noted initially.  The patient also has a history of prostate cancer and a renal cell carcinoma.  The patient at that point underwent a bronchoscopy with a biopsy of the mediastinal mass and the results of that biopsy are still pending.  The patient later saw a local oral surgeon.  He diagnosed his mandible fracture and advised him to seek treatment in Houston.  He presented to my office for evaluation on January 18, 2010, and he was found to have an extremely atrophic mandible with a fracture in the left parasymphysis region involving a failed dental implant, which had been placed approximately 15 years ago.  The patient had significant discomfort and could eat foods and drink fluids with difficulty.  Due to the nature of his fracture and the complex medical history, he was sent to the hospital for admission and following cardiac clearance, he was scheduled for surgery today.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the operating room, and placed in a supine position.  Following a nasal intubation and induction of general anesthesia, the surgeon then scrubbed, gowned, and gloved in the normal sterile fashion.  The patient was then prepped and draped in a manner consistent with sterile procedures.  A marking pen was first used to outline the incision in the submental region and it was extended from the left mandibular body to the right mandibular body region, approximately 1.5 cm medial to the inferior border of the mandible.  A 1 mL of lidocaine 1% with 1:100,000 epinephrine was then infiltrated along the incision and then a 15-blade was used to incise through the skin and subcutaneous tissue.  A combination of sharp and blunt dissection was then used to carry the dissection superiorly to the inferior border of the mandible.  Electrocautery as well as 4.0 silk ties were used for hemostasis.  A 15-blade was then used to incise the periosteum along the inferior border of the mandible and it was reflected exposing the mandible as well as the fracture site.  The fracture site was slightly distracted allowing access to the dental implant within the bone and it was easily removed from the wound.  Cultures of this site were also obtained and then the granulation tissue from the wound was also curetted free of the wound and sent for a histologic diagnosis.  Manipulation of the mandible was then used to achieve an anatomic reduction and then an 11-hole Synthes reconstruction plate was then used to stand on the fracture site.  Since there was an area of weakness in the right parasymphysis region, in the location of another dental implant, the bone plate was extended posterior to that site.  When the plate was adapted to the mandible, it was then secured to the bone with 9 screws, each being 2 mm in diameter and each screw was placed bicortically.  All the screws were also locking screws.  Following placement of the screws, there was felt to be excellent stability of the fracture, so the wound was irrigated with a copious amount of normal saline.  The incision was closed in multiple layers with 4.0 Vicryl in the muscular and subcutaneous layers and 5.0 nylon in the skin.  A sterile dressing was then placed over the incision.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room with spontaneous respirations and stable vital signs.  Estimated blood loss is 125 mL.\",\r",{"entities":[[35,94,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[96,117,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[146,205,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[207,228,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[253,333,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[335,390,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[406,426,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[452,458,"CARDINAL"],[476,479,"CARDINAL"],[483,495,"MEDICATION"],[509,521,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[530,538,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[553,573,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[575,583,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[601,659,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[711,723,"CARDINAL"],[779,786,"SYMPTOM"],[804,816,"SYMPTOM"],[824,828,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[851,860,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[881,900,"SYMPTOM"],[934,942,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[976,991,"LOC"],[1033,1047,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1066,1072,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1080,1097,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1110,1126,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1133,1151,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1211,1227,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1233,1253,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1294,1306,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1314,1320,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1328,1345,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1369,1375,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1458,1475,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1513,1520,"LOC"],[1566,1583,"DATE"],[1613,1640,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1648,1689,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1702,1723,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1761,1773,"TIME"],[1804,1814,"SYMPTOM"],[1825,1867,"SYMPTOM"],[1895,1903,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1993,2000,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2033,2040,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2041,2046,"DATE"],[2162,2178,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2183,2214,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2443,2459,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2488,2509,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2516,2545,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2561,2567,"CARDINAL"],[2568,2613,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2618,2623,"CARDINAL"],[2626,2635,"MEDICATION"],[2636,2639,"PERCENT"],[2644,2653,"CARDINAL"],[2654,2665,"MEDICATION"],[2717,2725,"CARDINAL"],[2757,2761,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2766,2785,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2804,2831,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2859,2869,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2888,2920,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2922,2936,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2948,2952,"CARDINAL"],[2991,2999,"CARDINAL"],[3028,3038,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3049,3080,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3115,3123,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3139,3147,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3159,3167,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3246,3250,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3294,3302,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3348,3366,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3433,3453,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3476,3484,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3544,3552,"CARDINAL"],[3611,3619,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3654,3696,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3828,3836,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3865,3869,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3875,3876,"CARDINAL"],[3896,3900,"CARDINAL"],[4205,4209,"CARDINAL"],[4223,4231,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4236,4255,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4260,4264,"CARDINAL"],[4277,4281,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4494,4500,"CARDINAL"]]}],["        \"CC: ,Gait difficulty.,HX: ,This 59 y/o RHF was admitted with complaint of gait difficulty.

She was discharged home on ASA.,At follow-up, on 2/23/96, she complained of left sided paresthesias (worse in the LLE than in the LUE) and feeling of \\\"swollen left foot.\\\" These symptoms had developed approximately 1 month after her stroke. Her foot looked normal and her UE strength was 5/4+ proximally and distally, and LE strength 5/4+ proximally and 5/5- distally. She was ambulatory. There was no evidence of LUE upward drift. A somatosensory evoked potential study revealed an absent N20 and normal P14 potentials. This was suggestive of a lesion involving the right thalamus which might explain her paresthesia/dysesthesia as part of a Dejerine-Roussy syndrome.\",\r",{"entities":[[14,29,"SYMPTOM"],[41,47,"CARDINAL"],[83,98,"SYMPTOM"],[104,117,"TIME"],[141,177,"SYMPTOM"],[192,213,"SYMPTOM"],[219,244,"SYMPTOM"],[272,282,"SYMPTOM"],[284,299,"SYMPTOM"],[301,311,"SYMPTOM"],[313,316,"SYMPTOM"],[317,331,"SYMPTOM"],[333,335,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[337,343,"SYMPTOM"],[347,355,"SYMPTOM"],[363,376,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[378,391,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[393,401,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[402,406,"DATE"],[408,411,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[413,415,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[432,443,"DATE"],[485,492,"CARDINAL"],[552,555,"CARDINAL"],[556,559,"CARDINAL"],[561,566,"CARDINAL"],[568,577,"CARDINAL"],[639,649,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[688,696,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[726,732,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[733,736,"CARDINAL"],[751,755,"CARDINAL"],[777,782,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[802,806,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[875,881,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[943,970,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[974,1003,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1005,1033,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1038,1046,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1100,1123,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1132,1162,"SYMPTOM"],[1352,1373,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1381,1414,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1416,1442,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1469,1476,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1492,1498,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1512,1520,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1544,1589,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1613,1617,"CARDINAL"],[1623,1626,"PERCENT"],[1632,1636,"CARDINAL"],[1642,1645,"CARDINAL"],[1689,1703,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1747,1755,"CARDINAL"],[1791,1803,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1816,1830,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1832,1838,"PERCENT"],[1847,1852,"PERCENT"],[1852,1865,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1870,1904,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1919,1948,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1960,1980,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1981,2010,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2017,2036,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2063,2073,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2092,2099,"TIME"],[2148,2180,"SYMPTOM"],[2199,2252,"SYMPTOM"],[2258,2294,"SYMPTOM"],[2327,2398,"SYMPTOM"],[2412,2427,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2437,2501,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2518,2532,"SYMPTOM"],[2604,2621,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2623,2629,"DATE"],[2642,2687,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2693,2700,"CARDINAL"],[2726,2733,"CARDINAL"],[2737,2742,"MEDICATION"],[2758,2842,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2846,2852,"DATE"],[2947,2954,"DATE"],[2974,2997,"SYMPTOM"],[3050,3067,"SYMPTOM"],[3114,3127,"TIME"],[3132,3138,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3144,3148,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3171,3173,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3187,3191,"CARDINAL"],[3221,3223,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3233,3237,"CARDINAL"],[3252,3258,"CARDINAL"],[3313,3329,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3333,3346,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3389,3392,"CARDINAL"],[3404,3407,"CARDINAL"],[3445,3480,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3505,3516,"SYMPTOM"],[3517,3528,"SYMPTOM"],[3542,3566,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"]]}],["        \"DIAGNOSIS: , Chronic laryngitis, hoarseness.,HISTORY:  ,The patient is a 68-year-old male, was referred to Medical Center's Outpatient Rehabilitation Department for skilled speech therapy secondary to voicing difficulties.

He reported to the Hospital the day after his altercation complaining of mall occlusion and sore left shoulder.  He was worked up by the emergency department.  His head CT was cleared and his left shoulder was clear of any fractures or soft tissue damage.  Oral maxillary facial surgery was consulted to manage the mandible fracture.  After review of the CT and examination it was determined that the patient would benefit from open reduction, internal fixation of bilateral mandible fractures.  Risks, benefits, and alternative to treatment were thoroughly discussed with the patient and consent was obtained.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:, The patient was brought to the operating room #2 at Hospital.  He was laid in supine position on the operating room table.  ASA monitors were attached and stated general anesthesia was induced with IV anesthetic and maintained with nasal endotracheal intubation and inflation anesthetics.,The patient was prepped and draped in the usual oral maxillofacial surgery fashion.  The surgeon approached the operating room table in a sterile fashion.  Approximately 10 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into oral vestibule in a nerve block fashion.  Erich arch bars were adapted to the maxilla and mandible, secured in the posterior teeth with 24-gauge surgical steel wire and 26-gauge surgical steel wire in the anterior.  This was done from second molar to second molar on both the maxilla and the mandible secondary to the patient missing multiple teeth.  The patient was manipulated up into maximum intercuspation.  He has a malocclusion with severe bruxism and so wear facets were lined up.  This was secured with 26-gauge surgical steel wire.  Attention was then directed to the symphysis extraorally.  Approximately 5 mL of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was injected into the area of incision which paralleled the inferior border of the mandible 2 cm below the inferior border of the mandible.,After waiting appropriate time for local anesthesia using a 15 blade, a skin and platysma incision was made.  Then using a series of blunt and sharp dissections, the dissection was carried to the inferior border of the mandible.  The periosteum was incised and reflected with the periosteal elevator.  The fracture was noted and it was displaced.  Manipulation of the segments and checking with the occlusion intraorally, the fracture was aligned.  This was secured with 7-hole 2.3 titanium locking reconstruction plate with bicortical screws.  The wound was then packed with moist Ray-Tec and attention was directed intraorally to the left angle fracture.  Approximately 5 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine was injected into the left vestibule.  After waiting appropriate time for local anesthesia to take effect, using Bovie electrocautery, a sagittal split incision was made and the fracture was identified.  It was noted that the fracture went through tooth #17 and this needed to be extracted.  Taking a round bur, a buckle trough was made and the tooth was elevated and removed both distal and mesial roots.  The fracture was then reduced and lateral superior border plate 2-0 4 whole with monocortical screws was placed.  The fracture was noted to be well reduced.  The wound was then irrigated with copious amount of sterile water.  The patient was released for excellent intercuspation.  He was then manipulated up into the occlusion easily.  Wound was then closed with running 3-0 chromic gut suture.  Attention was then directed extraorally.  This was irrigated with copious amount of sterile water and closed in a layer fashion with 3-0 Vicryl, 4-0 Vicryl, and 5-0 Prolene on skin.  Attention was then again directed into the mouth.  The throat pack was removed and orogastric tube was placed and stomach content was evacuated.  The patient was then manipulated back up to maximum intercuspation and secured with interdental elastics and a pressure dressing was applied to the extraoral incisions.  At this point, the procedure was then determined to be over.,The patient was extubated and breathing spontaneously, transported to the PACU in excellent condition.\",\r",{"entities":[[35,79,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[81,87,"CARDINAL"],[93,119,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[121,127,"CARDINAL"],[156,200,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[202,208,"CARDINAL"],[213,240,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[242,248,"CARDINAL"],[263,335,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[371,376,"CARDINAL"],[382,410,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[411,415,"CARDINAL"],[425,430,"CARDINAL"],[446,498,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[510,517,"CARDINAL"],[521,523,"MEDICATION"],[548,555,"CARDINAL"],[570,574,"CARDINAL"],[635,644,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[651,654,"CARDINAL"],[683,693,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[765,774,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[891,902,"CARDINAL"],[919,926,"TIME"],[984,1012,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1017,1047,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1081,1091,"TIME"],[1123,1138,"SYMPTOM"],[1142,1160,"SYMPTOM"],[1214,1222,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1241,1255,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1273,1282,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1286,1304,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1365,1382,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1405,1407,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1412,1423,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1478,1492,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1493,1543,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1734,1736,"CARDINAL"],[1850,1868,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1886,1899,"MEDICATION"],[1920,1949,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2147,2152,"CARDINAL"],[2156,2158,"PERCENT"],[2159,2168,"MEDICATION"],[2173,2183,"CARDINAL"],[2184,2195,"MEDICATION"],[2214,2228,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2234,2246,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2292,2299,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2304,2312,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2339,2344,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2350,2358,"CARDINAL"],[2383,2391,"CARDINAL"],[2449,2461,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2465,2478,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2490,2497,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2506,2514,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2515,2524,"CARDINAL"],[2557,2562,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2635,2647,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2653,2668,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2680,2686,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2725,2734,"CARDINAL"],[2790,2812,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2829,2833,"CARDINAL"],[2837,2839,"PERCENT"],[2840,2849,"MEDICATION"],[2855,2866,"MEDICATION"],[2926,2958,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2959,2963,"CARDINAL"],[2974,3005,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3042,3059,"MEDICATION"],[3067,3075,"CARDINAL"],[3078,3105,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3156,3167,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3173,3183,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3203,3234,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3241,3251,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3313,3321,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3433,3441,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3478,3488,"CARDINAL"],[3642,3662,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3679,3683,"CARDINAL"],[3687,3689,"PERCENT"],[3690,3699,"MEDICATION"],[3705,3714,"CARDINAL"],[3715,3726,"MEDICATION"],[3749,3763,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3800,3817,"MEDICATION"],[3840,3860,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3864,3887,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3905,3913,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3953,3961,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[3975,3980,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3981,3984,"CARDINAL"],[4007,4016,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[4107,4132,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4138,4163,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[4198,4204,"CARDINAL"],[4252,4260,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[4506,4510,"CARDINAL"],[4663,4667,"CARDINAL"],[4676,4679,"CARDINAL"],[4692,4696,"CARDINAL"],[4707,4711,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4757,4762,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4769,4775,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4797,4812,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[4828,4835,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"]]}],["        \"XYZ Street,City, State,Dear Dr. CD:,Thank you for seeing Mr. XYZ, a pleasant 19-year-old male who has seen you in 2005 for suspected seizure activity.

Patient reports that she is scared to eat because of its impact on her blood sugars.  She is actually trying not to eat while she is working third shift at Wal-Mart.  Historically however, she likes to eat out with a high frequency.  She enjoys eating rice as part of her meals.  She is complaining of feeling fatigued and tired all the time because she works from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. at Wal-Mart and has young children at home.  She sleeps two to four hours at a time throughout the day.  She has been testing for ketones first thing in the morning when she gets home from work.,OBJECTIVE:,  Today's weight:  155.5 pounds.  Weight from 10/07/04 was 156.7 pounds.  A diet history was obtained.  Blood sugar records for the last three days reveal the following:  fasting blood sugars 83, 84, 87, 77; two-hour postprandial breakfast 116, 107, 97; pre-lunch 85, 108, 77; two-hour postprandial lunch 86, 131, 100; pre-supper 78, 91, 100; two-hour postprandial supper 125, 121, 161; bedtime 104, 90 and 88.  I instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for gestational diabetes.  The Lily Guide for Meal Planning was provided and reviewed.  Additional information on gestational diabetes was applied.  A sample 2000-calorie meal plan was provided with a carbohydrate budget established.,ASSESSMENT:,  Patient's basal energy expenditure adjusted for obesity is estimated at 1336 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements, including a physical activity factor as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals to 2036 calories per day.  Her diet history reveals that she has somewhat irregular eating patterns.  In the last 24 hours when she was working at Wal-Mart, she ate at 5 a.m. but did not eat anything prior to that since starting work at 10 p.m.  We discussed the need for small frequent eating.  We identified carbohydrate as the food source that contributes to the blood glucose response.  We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are all good for her.  The only carbohydrates she was asked to entirely avoid would be the concentrated forms of refined sugars.  In regard to use of her traditional foods of rice, I pulled out a one-third cup measuring cup to identify a 15-gram equivalent of rice.  We discussed the need for moderating the portion of carbohydrates consumed at one given time.  Emphasis was placed at eating with a high frequency with a goal of eating every two to four hours over the course of the day when she is awake.  Her weight loss was discouraged.  Patient was encouraged to eat more generously but with attention to the amount of carbohydrates consumed at a time.,PLAN:,  The meal plan provided has a carbohydrate content that represents 40 percent of a 2000-calorie meal plan.  The meal plan was devised to distribute her carbohydrates more evenly throughout the day.  The meal plan was meant to reflect an example for her eating, while the patient was encouraged to eat according to appetite and not to go without eating for long periods of time.  The meal plan is as follows:  breakfast 2 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, lunch 2-3 carbohydrate servings, snack 1 carbohydrate serving, dinner 2-3 carbohydrate servings, bedtime snack 1-2 carbohydrate servings.  Recommend patient include a solid protein with each of her meals as well as with her snack that occurs before going to sleep.  Encouraged adequate rest.  Also recommend adequate calories to sustain weight gain of one-half to one pound per week.

The patient reports that she was hospitalized over the weekend for DKA.  She indicates that her blood sugar on Friday night was 187 at bedtime and that when she woke up in the morning her blood sugar was 477.  She gave herself, in smaller increments, a total of 70 extra units of her Humalog.  Ten of those units were injectable; the others were in the forms of pump.  Her blood sugar was over 600 when she went to the hospital later that day.  She is here at this consultation complaining of not feeling well still because she has a cold.  She realizes that this is likely because her immune system was so minimized in the hospital.,OBJECTIVE:,  Current insulin doses on her insulin pump are boluses set at 5 units at breakfast, 6 units at lunch and 11 units at supper.  Her basal rates have not been changed since her last visit with Charla Yassine and totaled 30.5 units per 24 hours.  A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on carbohydrate counting at 1 unit of insulin for every 10 g carbohydrate ratio was recommended.  A correction dose of approximately 1 unit of insulin to bring the blood sugars down 30 mg/dl was also recommended.  The Lilly guide for meal planning was provided and reviewed.  Additional carbohydrate counting book was provided.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient was taught an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio of 1 unit to 10 g of carbohydrates as recommended at the previous visit two years ago, which she does not recall.  It is based on the 500 rule which suggests this ratio.  We did identify carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing 15-g equivalents.  We also identified the need to dose her insulin at the time that she is eating her carbohydrate sources.  She does seem to have a pattern of fixing blood sugars later in the day after they are elevated.  We discussed the other option of trying to eat a consistent amount of carbohydrates at meals from day to day and taking a consistent amount of insulin at those meals.  With this in mind, she was recommended to follow with three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at breakfast, three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at lunch and four servings or 60 g of carbohydrate at dinner.  Joanne Araiza joined our consultation briefly to discuss whether her pump was working appropriately.

The patient also underwent a bilateral right total knee replacement in the same sitting and that will be dictated by Dr. X.,TOURNIQUET TIME: , 76 minutes.,BLOOD LOSS: , 150 cc.,ANESTHESIA:  ,General.,IMPLANT USED FOR PROCEDURE:,  NexGen size F femur on the left with #8 size peg tibial tray, a #12 mm polyethylene insert and this a cruciate retaining component.  The patella on the left was not resurfaced.,GROSS INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , Degenerative ware of three compartments of the trochlea, the medial, as well as the lateral femoral condyles as well was the plateau.  The surface of the patella was with a minimal ware and minimal osteophytes and we decided not to resurface the patellar component.,HISTORY:  ,This is a 69-year-old male with complaints of bilateral knee pain for several years and increased intensity in the past several months where it has affected his activities of daily living.  He attempted conservative treatment, which includes anti-inflammatory medications as well as cortisone and Synvisc.  This has only provided him with temporary relief.  It is for that reason, he is elected to undergo the above-named procedure.,All risks as well as complications were discussed with the patient, which include, but are not limited to infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, need for further surgery, and further pain.  He has agreed to undergo this procedure and a consent was obtained preoperatively.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was wheeled back to operating room #2 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/19/03 and was placed supine on the operating room table.  At this time, a nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the left upper thigh, but not inflated.  An Esmarch was then used to exsanguinate the extremity and the left extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure.  The tourniquet was then inflated to 325 mmHg.  At this time, a standard midline incision was made towards the total knee.  We did discuss preoperatively for a possible unicompartmental knee replacement for this patient, but he did have radiographic evidence of chondrocalcinosis of the lateral meniscus.  We did start off with a small midline skin incision in case we were going to do a unicompartmental.  Once we exposed the medial parapatellar mini-arthrotomy and visualized the lateral femoral condyle, we decided that this patient would not be an optimal candidate for unicompartmental knee replacement.  It is for this reason that we extended the incision and underwent with the total knee replacement.  Once the full medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed with the subperiosteal dissection of the proximal tibia in order to evert the patella.  Once the patella was everted, we then used a drill to cannulate the distal femoral canal in order to place the intramedullary guide.  A Charnley awl was then used to remove all the intramedullary contents and they were removed from the knee.  At this time, a femoral sizer was then placed with reference to the posterior condyles and we measured a size F. Once this was performed, three degrees of external rotation was then drilled into the condyle in alignment with the epicondyles of the femur.  At this time, the intramedullary guide was then inserted and placed in three degrees of external rotation.  Our anterior cutting guide was then placed and an anterior cut was performed with careful protection of the soft tissues.  Next, this was removed and the distal femoral cutting guide was then placed in five degrees of valgus.  This was pinned to the distal femur and with careful protection of the collateral ligaments, a distal femoral cut was performed.  At this time, the intramedullary guide was removed and a final cutting block was placed.  This was placed in the center on the distal femur with 1 mm to 2 mm laterally translated for better patellar tracking.  At this time, the block was pinned and screwed in place with spring pins with careful protection of the soft tissues.  An oscillating saw was then used to resect the posterior and anterior cutting blocks with anterior and posterior chamfer as well as the notch cut.  Peg holes were then drilled.,The block was then removed and an osteotome was then used to remove all the bony cut pieces.  At this time with a better exposure of the proximal tibia, we placed external tibial guide.  This was placed with longitudinal axis of the tibia and carefully positioned in order to obtain an optimal cut for the proximal tibia.  At this time with careful soft tissue retraction and protection, an oscillating saw was used to make a proximal tibial osteotomy.  Prior to the osteotomy, the cut was checked with a depth gauge in order to assure appropriate bony resection.  At this time, a _blunt Kocher and Bovie cautery were used to remove the proximal tibial cut, which had soft tissue attachments.  Once this was removed, we then implanted our trial components of size F to the femur and a size 8 mm tibial tray with 12 mm plastic articulating surface.  The knee was taken through range of motion and revealed excellent femorotibial articulation.  The patella did tend to sublux somewhat laterally with extremes of flexion and it was for this reason, we performed a minimal small incision lateral retinacular release.  Distal lateral patella was tracked more uniformly within the patellar groove of the prosthesis.  At this time, an intraoperative x-ray was performed, which revealed excellent alignment with no varus angulation especially of the whole femur and tibial alignment and tibial cut.  At this time, the prosthesis was removed.  A McGill retractor was then reinserted and replaced peg tibial tray in order to peg the proximal tibia.  Once the drill holes were performed, we then copiously irrigated the wound and then suctioned it dry to get ready and prepped for cementation of the drilled components.  At this time, polymethyl methacrylate cement was then mixed.  The cement was placed on the tibial surface as well as the underneath surface of the component.  The component was then placed and impacted with excess cement removed.  In a similar fashion, the femoral component was also placed.  A 12 mm plastic tray was then placed and the leg held in full extension and compression in order to obtain adequate bony cement content.  Once the cement was fully hardened, the knee was flexed and a small osteotome was used to remove any extruding cement from around the prosthesis of the bone.  Once this was performed, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound and the wound was then suctioned dry.  The knee was again taken through range of motion with a 12 mm plastic as well as #14.  The #14 appeared to be a bit too tight especially in extremes of flexion.  We decided to go with a #12 mm polyethylene tray.  At this time, this was placed to the tibial articulation and then left in place.  This was rechecked with careful attention to detail with checking no soft tissue interpositioned between the polyethylene tray and the metal tray of the tibia.  The knee was again taken through range of motion and revealed excellent tracking of the patella with good femur and tibial contact.  A drain was placed and cut to length.,At this time, the knee was irrigated and copiously suction dried.  #1-0 Ethibond suture was then used to approximate the medial parapatellar arthrotomy in figure-of-eight fashion.  A tight capsular closure was performed.  This was reinforced with a #1-0 running Vicryl suture.  At this time, the knee was again taken through range of motion to assure tight capsular closure.  At this time, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the superficial wound.  #2-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the wound with figure-of-eight inverted suture.  The skin was then approximated with staples.  The leg was then cleansed.  Sterile dressing consisting of Adaptic, 4x4, ABDs, and Kerlix roll were then applied.  At this time, the patient was extubated and transferred to recovery in stable condition.  Prognosis is good for this patient.\",\r",{"entities":[[34,73,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[101,140,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[165,192,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[196,204,"DATE"],[236,274,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[324,329,"PERSON"],[350,360,"TIME"],[376,382,"CARDINAL"],[398,405,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[451,456,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[474,476,"CARDINAL"],[501,507,"CARDINAL"],[574,594,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[647,779,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[786,808,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[820,832,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[837,856,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[893,911,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[934,946,"CARDINAL"],[970,989,"SYMPTOM"],[994,1008,"TIME"],[1011,1031,"SYMPTOM"],[1039,1058,"TIME"],[1072,1112,"SYMPTOM"],[1166,1195,"MEDICATION"],[1207,1216,"MEDICATION"],[1221,1228,"MEDICATION"],[1463,1472,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1474,1494,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1496,1514,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[1533,1540,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1554,1558,"SYMPTOM"],[1704,1706,"CARDINAL"],[1735,1744,"DATE"],[1852,1868,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[1917,1943,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[1951,1967,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2080,2089,"CARDINAL"],[2108,2133,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2161,2165,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2213,2247,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2306,2347,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[2380,2402,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2432,2448,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2471,2506,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2525,2549,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2618,2651,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2728,2751,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2762,2799,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2822,2846,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[2853,2869,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2891,2898,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2910,2917,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[2969,2989,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3012,3026,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3082,3096,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3137,3141,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3212,3230,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3281,3296,"CARDINAL"],[3343,3350,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3373,3397,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3418,3432,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3472,3484,"CARDINAL"],[3558,3571,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3616,3628,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3662,3676,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3710,3722,"CARDINAL"],[3758,3770,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3806,3826,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3830,3849,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[3883,3897,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[3992,4005,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4010,4014,"CARDINAL"],[4018,4023,"CARDINAL"],[4179,4191,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4507,4522,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4578,4610,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4676,4691,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4694,4707,"TIME"],[4720,4731,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[4797,4822,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[4838,4847,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[4936,4948,"TIME"],[4959,4983,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[5039,5050,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5144,5149,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5161,5166,"CARDINAL"],[5183,5189,"CARDINAL"],[5196,5217,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5224,5228,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5318,5325,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5432,5482,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[5484,5508,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5599,5619,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[5677,5695,"MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS"],[5719,5724,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[5762,5775,"TIME"],[5894,5908,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[6081,6093,"TIME"],[6171,6186,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[6338,6345,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[6376,6381,"CARDINAL"],[6552,6556,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[6664,6668,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[6789,6793,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[6841,6846,"CARDINAL"],[6866,6869,"CARDINAL"],[6875,6880,"CARDINAL"],[6971,6977,"CARDINAL"],[7034,7054,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[7148,7160,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[7233,7238,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[7245,7249,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[7329,7336,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[7347,7352,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[7357,7363,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[7430,7434,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[7479,7483,"CARDINAL"],[7532,7564,"MEDICAL PROCEDURE"],[7661,7665,"CARDINAL"],[7708,7712,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[7866,7871,"CARDINAL"],[7955,7959,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[8001,8004,"ANATOMICAL LOCATION"],[8065,8068,"CARDINAL"],[8112,8124,"TIME"]]}],["        \"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:,1.

There was no endometriosis in the right pelvic sidewall or along the bladder flap.,There were some adhesions on the right abdominal sidewall from the previous appendectomy.  The liver margin, gallbladder, and bowel appeared normal.  The uterus was sounded to 9 cm.,PROCEDURE: , After consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room and general anesthetic was administered.  The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  Sterile speculum was placed in the patient's vagina.  The anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with vulsellum tenaculum.  The uterus was sounded to 9 cm.  The cervix was then serially dilated with Hank dilators.  A sharp curettage was performed until a gritty texture was noted in all aspects of the endometrium.  The moderate amount of tissue that was obtained was sent to Pathology.  The #20 Hank dilator was then replaced and the sterile speculum was removed.  Gloves were changed and attention was then turned to the abdomen where approximately 10 mm transverse infraumbilical incision was made.  The Veress needle was placed into this incision and the gas was turned on.  When good flow and low abdominal pressures were noted, the gas was turned up and the abdomen was allowed to insufflate.  The #11 mm trocar was then placed through this incision and a camera was placed with the above findings noted.
