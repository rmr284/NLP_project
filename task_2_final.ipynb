    "- Their ability to capture complex relationships, like drug-disease interactions or symptom-disease links, makes them particularly effective for medical applications. \n",
    "- They also benefit from transfer learning, as they are pre-trained on large datasets, and can be fine-tuned with smaller domain-specific datasets to improve performance in specific medical fields. \n",
    "- They are scalable and versatile, capable of adapting to various medical domains (e.g., oncology, psychiatry) and handling multilingual medical texts. \n",
    "- Additionally, they manage ambiguous or variable terminology well, disambiguating terms with multiple meanings (e.g., \"stroke\") and recognizing synonyms or different phrasings (e.g., \"heart attack\" vs. \"myocardial infarction\").\n",
    "\n",
    "_Disadvantages of LLMs for NER_\n",
    "- Despite their strengths, LLMs are resource-intensive, requiring substantial computational power, memory, and storage for training and inference, which may limit their practicality in low-resource settings. \n",
    "- Fine-tuning on medical data demands high-quality, annotated datasets that are expensive and time-consuming to create, and insufficiently diverse training data can lead to biases and poor generalization. \n",
    "- LLMs also lack transparency, making it difficult to understand or fix errors, and they are sensitive to noisy data, such as misspellings or informal notes in medical records. \n",
    "- Ethical and privacy concerns are significant, as improper handling of medical data could compromise patient confidentiality. \n",
    "- Errors in entity recognition, such as misclassifying a diagnosis or treatment, could have serious consequences in clinical contexts."

    "    -  Identifying medical entities (e.g., diseases, drugs, procedures) allows the system to understand document themes and assign categories more accurately.\n",
