      "Text: CLINICAL INDICATION:  ,Normal stress test.,PROCEDURES PERFORMED:,1.  Left heart cath.,2.  Selective coronary angiography.,3.  LV gram.,4.  Right femoral arteriogram.,5.  Mynx closure device.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was explained about all the risks, benefits, and alternatives of this procedure.  The patient agreed to proceed and informed consent was signed.,Both groins were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  After local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine, a 6-French sheath was inserted in the right femoral artery.  Left and right coronary angiography was performed using 6-French JL4 and 6-French 3DRC catheters.  Then, LV gram was performed using 6-French pigtail catheter.  Post LV gram, LV-to-aortic gradient was obtained.  Then, the right femoral arteriogram was performed.  Then, the Mynx closure device was used for hemostasis.  There were no complications.,HEMODYNAMICS: , LVEDP was 9.  There was no LV-to-aortic gradient.,CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY:,1.  Left main is normal.  It bifurcates into LAD and left circumflex.,2.  Proximal LAD at the origin of big diagonal, there is 50% to 60% calcified lesion present.  Rest of the LAD free of disease.,3.  Left circumflex is a large vessel and with minor plaque.,4.  Right coronary is dominant and also has proximal 40% stenosis.,SUMMARY:,1.  Nonobstructive coronary artery disease, LAD proximal at the origin of big diagonal has 50% to 60% stenosis, which is calcified.,2.  RCA has 40% proximal stenosis.,3.  Normal LV systolic function with LV ejection fraction of 60%.,PLAN: , We will treat with medical therapy.  If the patient becomes symptomatic, we will repeat stress test.  If there is ischemic event, the patient will need surgery for the LAD lesion.  For the time being, we will continue with the medical therapy.,\n",

Poor prep.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,  Colonoscopy with photos.,ANESTHESIA: , Conscious sedation per Anesthesia.,SPECIMENS:,  None.,HISTORY:,  The patient is an 85-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with a markedly decreased hemoglobin and blood loss anemia.  She underwent an EGD and attempted colonoscopy; however, due to a very poor prep, only a flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed at that time.  A coloscopy is now being performed for completion.,PROCEDURE:,  After proper informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the Endoscopy Suite.  She was placed in the left lateral position and was given sedation by the Anesthesia Department.  A digital rectal exam was performed and there was no evidence of mass.  The colonoscope was then inserted into the rectum.  There was some solid stool encountered.  The scope was maneuvered around this.  There was relatively poor prep as the scope was advanced through the sigmoid colon and portions of the descending colon.  The scope was then passed through the transverse colon and ascending colon to the cecum.  No masses or polyps were noted.  Visualization of the portions of the colon was however somewhat limited.  There were scattered diverticuli noted in the sigmoid.,The scope was slowly withdrawn carefully examining all walls.  Once in the rectum, the scope was retroflexed and nonsurgical internal hemorrhoids were noted.  The scope was then completely withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition.  She will be placed on a high-fiber diet and Colace and we will continue to monitor her hemoglobin.\n",

      "Text: REASON FOR VISIT:  ,Elevated PSA with nocturia and occasional daytime frequency.,HISTORY: , A 68-year-old male with a history of frequency and some outlet obstructive issues along with irritative issues.  The patient has had history of an elevated PSA and PSA in 2004 was 5.5.  In 2003, he had undergone a biopsy by Dr. X, which was negative for adenocarcinoma of the prostate.  The patient has had PSAs as high as noted above.  His PSAs have been as low as 1.6, but those were on Proscar.  He otherwise appears to be doing reasonably well, off the Proscar, otherwise does have some irritative symptoms.  This has been ongoing for greater than five years.  No other associated symptoms or modifying factors.  Severity is moderate.  PSA relatively stable over time.,IMPRESSION: , Stable PSA over time, although he does have some irritative symptoms.  After our discussion, it does appear that if he is not drinking close to going to bed, he notes that his nocturia has significantly decreased.  At this juncture what I would like to do is to start with behavior modification.  There were no other associated symptoms or modifying factors.,PLAN: , The patient will discontinue all caffeinated and carbonated beverages and any fluids three hours prior to going to bed.  He already knows that this does decrease his nocturia.  He will do this without medications to see how well he does and hopefully he may need no other additional medications other than may be changing his alpha-blocker to something of more efficacious.\n",
